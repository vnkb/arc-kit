description: "Generate Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS) procurement documentation for UK Digital Marketplace"
---

You are helping an enterprise architect prepare Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS) procurement documentation for the UK Digital Marketplace.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Context

**Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS)** is the UK Digital Marketplace framework for:

- Custom software development
- Hiring developers, architects, designers, and technical specialists
- Delivering specific digital project outcomes

This command generates DOS-compliant procurement documentation from your existing arc-kit project requirements.

## Instructions

> **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

### 0. Read the Template

**Read the template** (with user override support):

- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/dos-requirements-template.md` exists in the project root
- **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
- **If not found**: Read `.arckit/templates/dos-requirements-template.md` (default)

> **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize dos`

### 1. Read existing artifacts from the project context

**MANDATORY** (warn if missing):

- **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in 000-global) — Extract: technology standards, governance constraints for vendor proposals
  - If missing: ERROR — run `/arckit:principles` first to define governance standards
- **REQ** (Requirements) — Extract: BR/FR/NFR/INT/DR IDs, priorities, acceptance criteria — source of truth for DOS
  - If missing: ERROR — run `/arckit:requirements` first to define project needs

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):

- **STKE** (Stakeholder Analysis) — Extract: user personas, business drivers, evaluation priorities
  - If missing: WARN — consider running `/arckit:stakeholders` to understand stakeholder priorities
- **RSCH**/**AWRS**/**AZRS** (Technology Research) — Extract: technology decisions informing essential skills requirements

**OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently):

- **SOW** (Statement of Work) — Extract: additional procurement context, scope definitions
- **RISK** (Risk Register) — Extract: risks requiring vendor mitigation, compliance requirements

### 1b. Read external documents and policies

- Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract team capability evidence, previous submission scores, buyer requirements, evaluation feedback
- Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract organization-wide procurement templates, DOS framework guidance, approved supplier capabilities
- If no external DOS docs exist but they would improve the submission, ask: "Do you have any contractor CVs, previous DOS submissions, or buyer requirement documents? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

**Gathering rules** (apply to all user questions in this command):

- Ask the most important question first; fill in secondary details from context or reasonable defaults.
- **Maximum 2 rounds of questions total.** After that, infer the best answer from available context.
- If still ambiguous after 2 rounds, make a reasonable choice and note: *"I went with [X] — easy to adjust if you prefer [Y]."*

### 2. Identify the target project

- Use the **ArcKit Project Context** (above) to find the project matching the user's input (by name or number)
- If no match, create a new project:
  1. Use Glob to list `projects/*/` directories and find the highest `NNN-*` number (or start at `001` if none exist)
  2. Calculate the next number (zero-padded to 3 digits, e.g., `002`)
  3. Slugify the project name (lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with hyphens, trim)
  4. Use the Write tool to create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/README.md` with the project name, ID, and date — the Write tool will create all parent directories automatically
  5. Also create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/external/README.md` with a note to place external reference documents here
  6. Set `PROJECT_ID` = the 3-digit number, `PROJECT_PATH` = the new directory path
- Parse user input for additional context (budget, timeline, specific skills)

---

**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

**Construct Document ID**:

- **Document ID**: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-DOS-v{VERSION}` (e.g., `ARC-001-DOS-v1.0`)

**Populate Required Fields**:

*Auto-populated fields* (populate these automatically):

- `[PROJECT_ID]` → Extract from project path (e.g., "001" from "projects/001-project-name")
- `[VERSION]` → "1.0" (or increment if previous version exists)
- `[DATE]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME]` → "DOS Procurement Requirements"
- `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-DOS-v[VERSION]` → Construct using format above
- `[COMMAND]` → "arckit.dos"

*User-provided fields* (extract from project metadata or user input):

- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Full project name from project metadata or user input
- `[OWNER_NAME_AND_ROLE]` → Document owner (prompt user if not in metadata)
- `[CLASSIFICATION]` → Default to "OFFICIAL" for UK Gov, "PUBLIC" otherwise (or prompt user)

*Calculated fields*:

- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Current date + 30 days

*Pending fields* (leave as [PENDING] until manually updated):

- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to "Project Team, Architecture Team" or [PENDING]

**Populate Revision History**:

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit:dos` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

**Populate Generation Metadata Footer**:

The footer should be populated with:

```markdown
**Generated by**: ArcKit `/arckit:dos` command
**Generated on**: {DATE} {TIME} GMT
**ArcKit Version**: {ARCKIT_VERSION}
**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME} (Project {PROJECT_ID})
**AI Model**: [Use actual model name, e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"]
**Generation Context**: [Brief note about source documents used]
```

### 3. Generate DOS Procurement Documentation

Create directory: `projects/[project]/procurement/`

Before writing the file, read `.arckit/references/quality-checklist.md` and verify all **Common Checks** plus the **DOS** per-type checks pass. Fix any failures before proceeding.

Generate `projects/[project]/procurement/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-DOS-v1.0.md`:

```markdown

Related Arc-kit Commands:
- /arckit:evaluate - Create vendor evaluation framework after receiving proposals
- /arckit:hld-review - Set up HLD review process for vendor deliverables
- /arckit:dld-review - Set up DLD review process for vendor deliverables
- /arckit:traceability - Validate requirements traceability with vendor

Important: Maintain audit trail of all procurement decisions per Digital Marketplace requirements.
```

## Key Principles

2. **Requirements First**: Always pull from ARC-*-REQ-*.md - don't invent new requirements
3. **Principle Enforcement**: Ensure architecture principles constrain vendor proposals
4. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Reflect stakeholder priorities in evaluation criteria
5. **Technology-Agnostic**: Remove all implementation details from procurement docs
6. **Traceability**: Maintain requirement IDs (BR-xxx, FR-xxx, NFR-xxx, INT-xxx, DR-xxx) throughout
7. **Audit-Ready**: Structure supports Digital Marketplace audit requirements
8. **Gov.uk Aligned**: Use official terminology and link to authoritative guidance
9. **DOS-Focused**: This is ONLY for custom development - no G-Cloud content

## Error Handling

- **No principles**: ERROR "Run /arckit:principles first - governance standards required"
- **No requirements**: ERROR "Run /arckit:requirements first - nothing to procure"
- **No project**: Suggest the user run `/arckit:init` or provide a project name to create one
- **Wrong framework**: If user mentions G-Cloud or cloud services, suggest `/arckit:gcloud-search` instead

## Important Notes

- **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

$ARGUMENTS
```

## Instructions

> **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

1. **Identify the project**: The user should specify a project name or number
   - Example: "Create evaluation framework for payment gateway project"
   - Example: "Evaluate vendors for project 001"

2. **Read existing artifacts** from the project context:

   **MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
   - **REQ** (Requirements) — Extract: BR/FR/NFR/INT/DR requirements to evaluate vendors against
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:requirements` first
   - **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in 000-global) — Extract: Technology standards, governance constraints, compliance requirements for evaluation criteria
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:principles` first

   **RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
   - **SOW** (Statement of Work) — Extract: Pre-defined evaluation criteria, scope, deliverables
   - **DOS** (DOS Requirements) — Extract: Evaluation criteria, essential/desirable skills, assessment approach
   - **RSCH** / **AWRS** / **AZRS** (Research) — Extract: Market landscape, vendor options, technology recommendations
   - **GCLD** (G-Cloud Search, in procurement/) — Extract: Shortlisted services, feature comparisons, compliance matches

   **OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):
   - **STKE** (Stakeholder Analysis) — Extract: Evaluation panel composition, stakeholder priorities
   - **DPIA** (Data Protection Impact Assessment) — Extract: Data protection requirements for vendor assessment

3. **Read the templates** (with user override support):
   - **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/evaluation-criteria-template.md` exists in the project root
   - **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
   - **If not found**: Read `.arckit/templates/evaluation-criteria-template.md` (default)
   - **Also read** the scoring template: check `.arckit/templates/vendor-scoring-template.md` first, then `.arckit/templates/vendor-scoring-template.md`

   > **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize evaluate`

4. **Read external documents and policies**:
   - Read any **vendor proposals** in `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/` — extract proposed solution, pricing, team qualifications, case studies, certifications, SLA commitments
   - Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract industry benchmarks, analyst reports, reference check notes
   - Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract enterprise evaluation frameworks, procurement scoring templates, cross-project vendor assessment benchmarks
   - If no vendor proposals found, ask: "Do you have vendor proposal documents to evaluate? I can read PDFs and Word docs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor-name}/` and re-run, or skip to create the evaluation framework only."

**Gathering rules** (apply to all user questions in this command):

- Ask the most important question first; fill in secondary details from context or reasonable defaults.
- **Maximum 2 rounds of questions total.** After that, infer the best answer from available context.
- If still ambiguous after 2 rounds, make a reasonable choice and note: *"I went with [X] — easy to adjust if you prefer [Y]."*

5. **Determine the task**: The user may want to:
   - **Create evaluation framework** (before receiving proposals)
   - **Score a specific vendor** (after receiving proposal)
   - **Compare multiple vendors** (after receiving several proposals)

### Task A: Create Evaluation Framework

If creating a new framework:

1. **Define mandatory qualifications** (pass/fail):
   - Required certifications (e.g., PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, SOC 2)
   - Minimum experience requirements
   - Financial stability requirements
   - References from similar projects

2. **Create scoring criteria** (100 points total):
   - **Technical Approach** (typically 35 points):
     - Solution design quality
     - Architecture alignment with principles
     - Technology choices
     - Innovation and best practices
   - **Project Approach** (typically 20 points):
     - Methodology (Agile, Waterfall, hybrid)
     - Risk management approach
     - Quality assurance process
     - Change management approach
   - **Team Qualifications** (typically 25 points):
     - Relevant experience
     - Team composition
     - Key personnel CVs
     - Training and certifications
   - **Company Experience** (typically 10 points):
     - Similar project references
     - Industry expertise
     - Financial stability
     - Client retention rate
   - **Pricing** (typically 10 points):
     - Cost competitiveness
     - Pricing model clarity
     - Value for money

3. **Define evaluation process**:
   - Scoring methodology
   - Evaluation team composition
   - Review timeline
   - Decision criteria (e.g., must score >70 to be considered)

**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

**Construct Document ID**:

- **Document ID**: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-EVAL-v{VERSION}` (e.g., `ARC-001-EVAL-v1.0`)

**Populate Required Fields**:

*Auto-populated fields* (populate these automatically):

- `[PROJECT_ID]` → Extract from project path (e.g., "001" from "projects/001-project-name")
- `[VERSION]` → "1.0" (or increment if previous version exists)
- `[DATE]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME]` → "Vendor Evaluation Framework"
- `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-EVAL-v[VERSION]` → Construct using format above
- `[COMMAND]` → "arckit.evaluate"

*User-provided fields* (extract from project metadata or user input):

- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Full project name from project metadata or user input
- `[OWNER_NAME_AND_ROLE]` → Document owner (prompt user if not in metadata)
- `[CLASSIFICATION]` → Default to "OFFICIAL" for UK Gov, "PUBLIC" otherwise (or prompt user)

*Calculated fields*:

- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Current date + 30 days

*Pending fields* (leave as [PENDING] until manually updated):

- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to "Project Team, Architecture Team" or [PENDING]

**Populate Revision History**:

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit:evaluate` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

**Populate Generation Metadata Footer**:

The footer should be populated with:

```markdown
**Generated by**: ArcKit `/arckit:evaluate` command
**Generated on**: {DATE} {TIME} GMT
**ArcKit Version**: {ARCKIT_VERSION}
**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME} (Project {PROJECT_ID})
**AI Model**: [Use actual model name, e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"]
**Generation Context**: [Brief note about source documents used]
```

---

Before writing the file, read `.arckit/references/quality-checklist.md` and verify all **Common Checks** plus the **EVAL** per-type checks pass. Fix any failures before proceeding.

4. **Write output** to `projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-EVAL-v1.0.md`

### Task B: Score a Vendor Proposal

If scoring a specific vendor:

1. **Create vendor directory**: `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor-name}/`

2. **Ask key questions** to gather information:
   - "Do you have access to the vendor's proposal document?"
   - "What strengths stood out in their proposal?"
   - "What concerns or gaps did you notice?"
   - "How well does their approach align with requirements?"

3. **Score each category** based on the evaluation criteria:
   - Use the point system from ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-EVAL-v*.md
   - Provide specific justification for each score
   - Reference requirement IDs where applicable
   - Flag any mandatory qualifications that are missing (instant disqualification)

4. **Document findings**:
   - Overall score (e.g., 78/100)
   - Category breakdown
   - Strengths (what they did well)
   - Weaknesses (gaps or concerns)
   - Risk assessment
   - Recommendation (Recommend/Consider/Not Recommended)

5. **Write outputs**:
   - `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor-name}/evaluation.md` - Detailed scoring
   - `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor-name}/notes.md` - Additional notes
   - Update `projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-EVAL-v*.md` - Comparative table

### Task C: Compare Multiple Vendors

If comparing vendors:

1. **Read all vendor evaluations** from `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/*/evaluation.md`

2. **Create comparison matrix**:
   - Side-by-side scoring table
   - Strengths comparison
   - Risk comparison
   - Cost comparison (if available)

3. **Generate recommendation**:
   - Top choice with justification
   - Runner-up option
   - Risk mitigation for chosen vendor
   - Contract negotiation points

4. **Write output** to `projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-VEND-v1.0.md`

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Create Framework

User: `/arckit:evaluate Create evaluation framework for payment gateway project`

You should:

- Read requirements and SOW
- Define mandatory quals: PCI-DSS certified, 5+ years payment processing
- Create scoring criteria: Technical (35), Project (20), Team (25), Experience (10), Price (10)
- Write to `projects/001-payment-gateway/ARC-001-EVAL-v1.0.md`

### Example 2: Score Vendor

User: `/arckit:evaluate Score Acme Payment Solutions proposal for project 001`

You should:

- Ask for proposal details
- Create `projects/001-payment-gateway/vendors/acme-payment-solutions/`
- Score against criteria (e.g., Technical: 28/35, Team: 20/25, Total: 76/100)
- Document strengths: "Strong PCI-DSS expertise, good reference projects"
- Document weaknesses: "Limited cloud experience, timeline aggressive"
- Write evaluation and update summary table

### Example 3: Compare Vendors

User: `/arckit:evaluate Compare all vendors for payment gateway project`

You should:

- Read evaluations for all vendors in projects/001-payment-gateway/vendors/
- Create comparison: Acme (76), BestPay (82), CloudPayments (71)
- Recommend: BestPay - highest score, best cloud experience
- Write to `projects/001-payment-gateway/ARC-001-VEND-v1.0.md`

## Important Notes

- Evaluation must be objective and based on documented criteria
- All scores require specific justification (no arbitrary numbers)
- Mandatory qualifications are pass/fail (missing any = disqualified)
- Reference specific requirements (e.g., "Meets NFR-S-001 for PCI-DSS compliance")
- Document any conflicts of interest or bias
- Keep vendor proposals confidential (don't commit PDFs to git by default)
- Final decision authority always stays with the architect/client
- **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

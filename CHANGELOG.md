# Changelog

All notable changes to ArcKit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `/arckit.search` command for keyword, type, and requirement ID search across all project artifacts with pre-processing hook
- `/arckit.score` command for structured vendor scoring with JSON storage, comparison, sensitivity analysis, and audit trail
- `/arckit.impact` command for blast radius analysis and reverse dependency tracing

## [4.0.2] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- `/arckit.framework` command for transforming architecture artifacts into a structured, reusable framework (agent-delegating)
- `/arckit.glossary` command for generating comprehensive project glossary with terms, definitions, and cross-references
- `/arckit.maturity-model` command for generating capability maturity model with current-state assessment and improvement roadmap
- Missing guides for `dfd`, `health`, and `init` commands
- `dfd` command added to DEPENDENCY-MATRIX with row and column

### Fixed

- Framework command referenced wrong template filename (`framework-template.md` → `framework-overview-template.md`)
- Stale command counts (53 → 57) across all docs, guides, commands.html, and extension copies
- Stale agent counts (5 → 6) in MCP servers and remote control guides

## [2.22.6] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Add .worktrees/ to gitignore

## [2.22.5] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Template status line showed ambiguous Version label** — renamed `**Version**: [VERSION]` to `**ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]` on the status blockquote line across all 50 templates so AI correctly fills the ArcKit version instead of the document version
- **Tech-note and vendor-profile templates missing status line** — added the `> **Template Status**: Live | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION] | **Command**: ...` blockquote to align with the other 48 templates
- **Health command always writes docs/health.json** — ensures dashboard integration works even when docs directory already exists

## [2.22.4] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Traceability hook missed FR and NFR requirements** — heading regex only matched h3 (`###`) but the requirements template uses h4 (`####`) for FR, NFR, INT, and DR sections (plugin fix, see plugin CHANGELOG for details)

---

## [2.22.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Centralized doc type config** — `arckit-claude/config/doc-types.mjs` is the single source of truth for all 49 document type codes, replacing duplicated data across 5+ files
- **Research subdirectory routing** — research types (RSCH, AWRS, AZRS, GCRS, DSCT) are now multi-instance and auto-route to `research/` with sequence numbers
- **GAPS and VEND doc type codes** — Gap Analysis (Governance) and Vendor Evaluation (Procurement)

### Fixed

- **Command filename mismatches** — HLD→HLDR, DLD→DLDR, `data-mesh-contracts/`→`data-contracts/`
- **Inconsistent categories** — DSCT (Discovery), PLAT (Architecture), DFD (Architecture) standardized across all hooks

### Changed

- **Research agents use inline filenames** — removed `generate-document-id.py` calls from 5 agents; PreToolUse hook handles filename correction
- **Multi-instance types updated** — `generate-document-id.sh` and `.py` (both copies) now list all 10 multi-instance types

---

## [2.21.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Traceability pre-processor hook** — automatically extracts requirements from project artifacts and computes coverage metrics before the traceability command runs

---

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-20

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **SessionStart hook for version injection** — new `hooks/arckit-session.sh` fires once at session start, injecting the ArcKit plugin version into Claude's context and exporting `ARCKIT_VERSION` as an environment variable; also detects whether a `projects/` directory exists
- **OpenCode CLI support** — 4th distribution format via `arckit init --ai opencode`; adds `arckit-opencode/` extension directory, `.opencode/commands/` for CLI usage, `scripts/converter.py` generates OpenCode markdown alongside Codex and Gemini formats, 48 commands + 5 agents + MCP servers (AWS Knowledge, Microsoft Learn, Google Developer Knowledge)

### Changed

- **Removed per-command VERSION file reads from 46 commands** — commands no longer instruct Claude to read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/VERSION`; the version is now provided via `{ARCKIT_VERSION}` from the SessionStart hook context, eliminating a redundant Read tool call on every command invocation
- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.5.1] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **Removed `generate-document-id.sh` calls from 29 commands** — replaced bash script invocations with inline document ID format strings (e.g., `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-REQ-v{VERSION}`); the PreToolUse hook now auto-corrects ARC filenames, making script calls redundant

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **UserPromptSubmit hook for project context** — new `arckit-context.sh` hook automatically detects all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies before any `/arckit:` command runs, injecting structured context via `systemMessage`

### Changed

- **Refactored 39 commands to use hook-provided context** — removed boilerplate directory scanning, `ARC-*-TYPE-*.md` glob patterns, verbose external docs blocks, and `list-projects.sh` calls; replaced with compact hook-aware references (net -1,071 lines, 66% boilerplate reduction)

---

## [2.4.5] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **New `/arckit.dfd` command** — Data Flow Diagram (DFD) generation with multi-instance support, document control, and DFD-specific templates across all distribution formats (plugin, Codex, Gemini extension)
- **DFD multi-instance document type** — `DFD` added to `generate-document-id.sh` for sequential numbering (ARC-001-DFD-001, ARC-001-DFD-002, etc.)

### Changed

- **Explicit VERSION file path in all commands and agents** — all 49 commands and 5 agents now reference `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/VERSION` instead of bare `VERSION`, ensuring the ArcKit version is always read from the plugin's authoritative file regardless of project state

---

## [2.4.4] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **Windows cp1252 encoding fix** — added explicit `encoding='utf-8'` to all file I/O operations in `arckit init` to prevent `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows when writing files containing Unicode box-drawing characters (fixes #49)

---

## [2.4.3] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Data Commons MCP server for Gemini extension** — added `datacommons-mcp` to the Gemini extension MCP configuration

### Changed

- Version bump to 2.4.3 across all distribution formats

---

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Gemini CLI native extension** (`arckit-gemini/`) — install via `gemini extensions install https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini` for zero-config experience with automatic updates and bundled MCP servers
  - Published as separate repo [`tractorjuice/arckit-gemini`](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini), generated by `scripts/converter.py`
  - Extension manifest (`gemini-extension.json`) with MCP servers (AWS Knowledge, Microsoft Learn via mcp-remote) and optional Google API Key setting
  - Context file (`GEMINI.md`) with extension paths, document control standard, and project structure reference
  - All 48 commands with paths rewritten to `~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/`

### Fixed

- **Gemini extension workspace sandbox fix**: Extension commands now instruct the model to use `run_shell_command` (e.g., `cat`, `bash`) for accessing extension files at `~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/`, since Gemini CLI's `read_file` tool is restricted to the project workspace. Also rewrites `Read` instructions to `cat` commands in extension TOML output.
- **CLI/Codex path resolution bug**: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` references in generated Codex Markdown files are now rewritten to `.arckit` (project-local paths). Previously these paths were never resolved, breaking template and script references for Codex users.

### Changed

- **CLI is now Codex-only**: Removed Gemini CLI from the CLI package. Gemini users should use the native extension instead (`gemini extensions install https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini`). Running `arckit init --ai gemini` now prints a redirect message pointing to the extension.
- Deleted `.gemini/` directory from the repo (49 files) — project-local Gemini commands are no longer distributed via the CLI
- `scripts/converter.py` now generates 2 output formats: Codex Markdown (`.codex/`) and Gemini extension TOML (`arckit-gemini/`), with path rewriting for each target
- Removed `.gemini` from `pyproject.toml` shared-data
- Updated all documentation (README, CLAUDE.md, docs/index.html, upgrading guides) to reflect Codex-only CLI

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- Pass directory argument to `--next-num` in multi-instance commands (wardley, diagram, data-mesh-contract) to prevent unbound variable crash
- Added guard in `generate-document-id.sh` to give a clear error message when directory is missing
- Replace Mermaid `gitGraph` with `flowchart` in devops template — gitGraph has limited renderer support and fails with "No diagram type detected" errors in GitHub/VS Code
- Added diagram guidelines to devops command to prevent gitGraph usage in generated documents

---

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- Added explicit `list-projects.sh --json` step to 9 commands (stakeholders, requirements, adr, sow, roadmap, strategy, dpia, platform-design, data-mesh-contract) to prevent wrong script paths in plugin-based repos

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-09

- **Multi-AI Support**: Trello command available for Gemini CLI (`.gemini/commands/arckit/trello.toml`) and Codex CLI (`.codex/prompts/arckit/trello.md`)

- **Converter Codex Generation**: `scripts/converter.py` now generates both Gemini TOML and Codex Markdown from Claude commands
  - Added `generate_codex()` function alongside existing Gemini generation
  - Agent-delegating commands (research, datascout, aws-research, azure-research) have full agent prompts inlined for both formats
  - Codex prompts use YAML frontmatter with `description` field and keep `$ARGUMENTS` syntax
  - Single `python scripts/converter.py` run produces 92 files (46 Gemini + 46 Codex)

### Changed

- **Claude Code Plugin Migration**: Claude Code distribution migrated from CLI to standalone plugin (`arckit-claude/`). Claude Code users should install via `/plugin marketplace add tractorjuice/arc-kit` instead of `arckit init --ai claude`

  - Removed `tags` field from YAML frontmatter (unused by Codex CLI)
- **Gemini TOML Sync**: All 46 Gemini TOMLs regenerated with latest Claude command content
- **Template References**: 8 commands now explicitly reference their templates with user override support:
  - `/arckit.analyze` → `analysis-report-template.md`
  - `/arckit.dos` → `dos-requirements-template.md`
  - `/arckit.evaluate` → now references both `evaluation-criteria-template.md` and `vendor-scoring-template.md`
  - `/arckit.jsp-936` → `jsp-936-template.md`
  - `/arckit.mod-secure` → `mod-secure-by-design-template.md`

  - `hld-review`: HLD → HLDR (template aligned to command)
  - `mod-secure`: SECD → SECD-MOD (template aligned to command)
  - `roadmap`: ROADMAP → ROAD (template aligned to command)
- **Document Type Name Fixes**: 8 commands had incorrect or copy-pasted DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME values:
  - `tcop`, `sow`, `traceability`, `secure`: Had "Business and Technical Requirements" (copy-paste from requirements)
  - `ai-playbook`, `dos`, `gcloud-search`, `roadmap`: Mismatched between command and template
- **Hardcoded Version Fixes**: `roadmap-template.md` and `architecture-strategy-template.md` had hardcoded `v1.0` instead of `v[VERSION]`
- **Duplicate Footer Removal**: `sobc.md` had both standardized doc control block AND old "Populate Metadata Footer" block with wrong command reference
- **Pages Command**: Updated doc type codes (BLOG→BKLG, ROADMAP→ROAD, HLD→HLDR, DLD→DLDR), added STRAT, AWRS, AZRS, DSCT types

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- **External Document Support**: Standardized external document intake across all 39 commands and 4 agents
  - Commands auto-discover and consume user-provided files (vendor HLDs, policy docs, pen test reports, RFPs, audit reports, existing schemas, architecture diagram images)
  - Three standard locations: `projects/{project}/external/`, `projects/{project}/vendors/{vendor}/`, `projects/000-global/policies/`
  - Command-specific extraction guidance for each document type
  - Non-blocking: external docs enhance output quality but are never required
  - Generated documents include "External References" table citing consumed external docs
  - 6 command groups: Vendor (6), Policy & Governance (11), User Specification (8), Research (5), Operational (9), No Changes (4)

- **External References Table**: Added to all corresponding templates in `.arckit/templates/`
  - Populated when external docs are used, shows "None provided" otherwise
  - Columns: Document, Type, Source, Key Extractions, Path

- **Standard Directories**: CLI and scripts updated to create external document directories
  - `arckit init` creates `projects/000-global/policies/` directory
  - `create-project.sh` creates `external/` subdirectory in each numbered project
  - `.gitkeep` files ensure directories are tracked by git

- **v20 Test Repository**: `arckit-test-project-v20-uae-moi-ipad` (private) for UAE MOI IPAD Framework

### Changed

- **Dynamic Version Placeholders**: All 44 template metadata lines now use `[VERSION]` placeholder instead of hardcoded version numbers
  - Template metadata line: `> **Template Status**: [status] | **Version**: [VERSION] | **Command**: [command]`
  - Commands read the `VERSION` file at generation time and populate the placeholder
  - Eliminates version drift when bumping ArcKit version — only `VERSION` file needs updating

- **Command Version Fallbacks**: Updated all 13 commands with version fallbacks from `1.0.0` to current version
  - Commands that read VERSION file now have accurate fallback values

- **Converter Improvements** (`scripts/converter.py`): Enhanced agent-delegating command handling for Gemini TOML generation

- **CLAUDE.md**: Added v20 test repo to table and sync loop, added directory creation to sync script

### Fixed

- Stale `1.0.0` version fallbacks in 13 command files (should have been updated in 1.2.0)
- Hardcoded `1.0.0` version in all 44 template metadata lines (now dynamic `[VERSION]` placeholder)
- External document sections incorrectly nested inside "Detect Version" steps in 3 commands (story, adr, platform-design)

---

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

## [0.9.1] - 2025-11-12

### Added

- **Document Control Standard**: New reference in `docs/templates/document-control.md` plus README cross-links so every command references the same metadata expectations (Document ID, classification, review cadence, distribution, revision history, etc.).
- **Guides**: Added roadmap and ADR playbooks under `docs/guides/` to document the new workflows released in 0.9.0 and highlight where document control fits in those processes.

### Changed

- **Template Alignment**: All Markdown templates in `.arckit/templates/` now share the canonical Document Control table and revision history format, with doc-specific fields (e.g., ADR Number, Financial Years) appended below the standard block.
- **Command Updates**: Claude/Codex/Gemini instructions explicitly reference the new standard, require `generate-document-id.sh`, and ensure commands populate metadata before writing body content.
- **Dynamic Version Metadata**: `/arckit.sobc` and `/arckit.service-assessment` prompts (for every agent) read `.arckit/VERSION` so generated artifacts always show the current ArcKit release.
- **Docs Refresh**: README, docs index, workflow diagrams, dependency matrix, and command references updated to advertise v0.9.1 as the latest release.

### Fixed

- **Version Drift**: Removed remaining hardcoded `v0.9.0` strings so prompts either reference `.arckit/VERSION` or historical sections only.

## [0.8.2] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- **Dependency Matrix Accuracy**: Corrected 4 critical (M-level) dependency errors
  - `dos` now correctly requires principles (M) - ensures evaluation framework aligned with architecture governance
  - `evaluate` now correctly requires principles (M) - ensures vendor scoring criteria match organizational standards
  - `hld-review` now correctly requires principles (M) - validates design decisions against documented principles
  - `dld-review` now correctly requires principles (M) - ensures implementation adheres to architectural standards

- **High-Priority Dependencies**: Added 9 recommended (R-level) dependencies to improve quality
  - `plan` now recommends stakeholders (R), requirements (R), principles (R), sobc (R), risk (R) - creates realistic timelines based on project scope
  - `principles` now recommends gcloud-search (R) for G-Cloud procurement - ensures search criteria align with principles
  - `stakeholders` now recommends research (R), dos (R) - better procurement strategy and vendor requirements
  - `data-model` now recommends research (R) - data modeling informed by vendor research and technology choices
  - `service-assessment` now recommends plan (R) - validates timelines and delivery approach

- **Artifact Summary Counts**: Corrected consumer counts in dependency matrix
  - `principles.md` consumer count: 10 → 14 commands (added dos, gcloud-search, service-assessment)
  - `stakeholders.md` consumer count: 7 → 9 commands (added research, dos, service-assessment)

### Added

- **Comprehensive Dependency Documentation** (3 new documents):
  - `DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md` (191 lines) - 28×28 Dependency Structure Matrix showing all command dependencies
    - Matrix legend (M=Mandatory, R=Recommended, O=Optional)
    - 10-tier dependency hierarchy (Tier 0: Foundation → Tier 10: Compliance)
    - 5 critical paths (Standard, UK Gov, UK Gov AI, MOD Defence, MOD Defence AI)

### Changed

- **Command Template Enforcement**: Updated 4 command templates to enforce critical dependencies
  - `.claude/commands/arckit.dos.md` - Added principles (M) check with guidance
  - `.claude/commands/arckit.evaluate.md` - Added principles (M) check with guidance
  - `.claude/commands/arckit.hld-review.md` - Added principles (M) check with guidance
  - `.claude/commands/arckit.dld-review.md` - Added principles (M) check with guidance

### Why This Matters

The dependency matrix work ensures ArcKit commands are executed in the correct order, preventing:

- **Quality Issues**: Running evaluate without principles means vendor scoring isn't aligned with organizational standards
- **Rework**: Running hld-review/dld-review without principles means design decisions may violate governance
- **Incomplete Analysis**: Running plan without requirements means timelines don't reflect actual scope
- **Procurement Failures**: Running dos without stakeholders means vendor requirements don't address real needs

The comprehensive dependency documentation provides:

- **Clear Guidance**: 5 workflow diagrams showing exactly which commands to run for different project types
- **Traceability**: Complete dependency chain from foundation commands to final compliance assessments
- **Quality Assurance**: Artifact fan-in analysis shows requirements.md consumed by 22 commands (highest)

This release completes the dependency analysis initiative (Issue #9) with:

- Phase 1: 4 critical (M-level) fixes ✅
- Phase 2: 9 high-priority (R-level) enhancements ✅
- Phase 3: 26 optional (O-level) enhancements (future work)

### Why This Matters

JSP 936 (Dependable Artificial Intelligence in Defence), published November 2024, establishes the UK Ministry of Defence's mandatory framework for safe and responsible adoption of AI/ML systems. Defence projects using AI must complete JSP 936 assessments to receive approval at the appropriate level (2PUS/Ministerial for Critical, Defence-Level for Severe/Major, TLB-Level for Moderate/Minor).

Without JSP 936 compliance, defence AI projects face:

- Approval blockages (no deployment without JSP 936 assessment)
- Ethical risks unidentified until late stages
- Unclear accountability for AI decisions
- Inadequate bias testing and harm mitigation
- Missing security controls for AI-specific threats
- No continuous monitoring or drift detection

The `/arckit.jsp-936` command automates the creation of comprehensive JSP 936 compliance documentation, guiding project teams through:

- Systematic identification of all AI/ML components
- Ethical risk classification using MOD's likelihood × impact methodology
- Assessment against all 5 ethical principles (Human-Centricity, Responsibility, Understanding, Bias & Harm Mitigation, Reliability)
- Documentation for all 8 AI lifecycle phases
- Human-AI teaming strategy design
- AI-specific security threat assessment
- Continuous monitoring and re-assessment planning

This command ensures MOD AI projects have the documentation required for approval while embedding best practices for responsible AI throughout the lifecycle.

- **docs/index.html**: To be updated with backlog command in phase sections
- **Version**: Updated from v0.5.0 to v0.6.0 across all files

### Why This Matters

Product backlog creation is one of the most time-consuming tasks when transitioning from design (Alpha) to implementation (Beta). Teams spend 4-6 weeks manually converting requirements into user stories, estimating effort, prioritising work, and organising into sprints. This command automates that process in minutes, saving 75%+ of the time while maintaining GDS compliance and best practices.

The backlog command bridges the gap between ArcKit's design phase commands (`/arckit.requirements`, `/arckit.hld`) and implementation, providing a sprint-ready backlog that development teams can immediately use for sprint planning.

# Changelog — ArcKit Plugin

All notable changes to the ArcKit Claude Code plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `/arckit.impact` command for blast radius analysis and reverse dependency tracing
- `impact-scan.mjs` hook for dependency graph pre-processing

## [4.0.2] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- `/arckit.framework` command for transforming architecture artifacts into a structured, reusable framework (agent-delegating via arckit-framework agent)
- `/arckit.glossary` command for generating comprehensive project glossary with terms, definitions, acronyms, and cross-references
- `/arckit.maturity-model` command for generating capability maturity model with current-state assessment, target-state definition, and improvement roadmap
- `arckit-framework` agent for autonomous framework synthesis from architecture artifacts
- Missing guides for `dfd`, `health`, and `init` commands
- `dfd` command added to DEPENDENCY-MATRIX with row and column

### Fixed

- Framework command referenced wrong template filename (`framework-template.md` → `framework-overview-template.md`)
- Stale command counts (53 → 57) across all docs, guides, commands.html, and extension copies
- Stale agent counts (5 → 6) in MCP servers and remote control guides

## [3.1.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Improve skill descriptions and resolve content issues across all 4 plugin skills (#123)

### Changed

- Add .worktrees/ to gitignore

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Architecture Workflow process skill** — new `architecture-workflow` skill in `arckit-claude/skills/` that guides users through project onboarding with adaptive-depth questions and tailored command sequence recommendations
- 5 workflow path reference files: standard (private sector), UK Government, Defence, AI/ML modifier, Data platform modifier
- Patterns borrowed from Claude Code brainstorming skill: HARD-GATE, anti-patterns, one-question-at-a-time, adaptive depth

### Changed

- `/arckit:start` command refactored from 189-line inline logic to 21-line thin wrapper delegating to the architecture-workflow skill

## [3.0.9] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **Governance scan pre-processor hook** (`governance-scan.mjs`) — pre-extracts all artifact metadata, requirements, principles, risks, cross-references, vendor data, and placeholder counts for `/arckit:analyze`, eliminating 20-40 Read tool calls
- Three new shared functions in `hook-utils.mjs`: `extractRequirementDetails`, `extractPrinciples`, `extractRiskEntries`
- Hook-aware shortcut preamble in `analyze.md` — skips Steps 1-2 when pre-extracted data is present

### Changed

- `extractRequirementDetails` moved from `traceability-scan.mjs` to shared `hook-utils.mjs` — no behavioral change, same function in shared location

## [3.0.8] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Shared hook-utils module** — extracted 11 utility functions (`isDir`, `isFile`, `readText`, `listDir`, `mtimeMs`, `findRepoRoot`, `extractDocType`, `extractVersion`, `extractDocControlFields`, `extractRequirementIds`, `parseHookInput`) into `hook-utils.mjs`; updated 9 hooks to import from it, removing ~240 lines of duplicate code
- `COMPOUND_TYPES` now derived dynamically from `config/doc-types.mjs` instead of hardcoded — new compound doc types propagate automatically to all hooks

## [3.0.7] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- `/arckit.template-builder` command — interactive template builder that creates community-origin templates, guides, and optional shareable bundles through a 2-round interview process
- Three-tier origin model for templates and guides: Official, Custom, and Community with distinct banners
- Community guide discovery in `sync-guides.mjs` — scans `.arckit/guides-custom/` and includes community guides in the pages manifest under "Community" category
- `community.` prefix convention for user-generated slash commands
- Diagram quality gate v2 — element count thresholds per diagram type with split strategies, layout direction decision table (LR vs TB), expanded 9-criteria quality gate (was 6), per-criterion remediation table, and iterative review loop (max 3 iterations)

### Fixed

- **Wardley Maps, Data Contracts, Research, and Reviews missing from pages** — added all four doc types to sidebar navigation, search index, and dashboard counting in the pages template; added stats to the hook summary output
- **.gitkeep files leaked into manifest** — dotfiles in `external/` and `policies/` directories were included in the manifest scan; now filtered out
- **Stale statistics in docs/index.html** — updated document and command counts

### Changed

- All 50 official templates updated: `Template Status: <status>` replaced with `Template Origin: Official` banner
- All official guides updated with `Guide Origin: Official` banner after the first heading
- `/arckit:customize` now sets `Template Origin: Custom` banner when copying templates

## [2.22.5] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Template status line showed ambiguous Version label** — renamed `**Version**: [VERSION]` to `**ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]` on the status blockquote line across all 50 templates so AI correctly fills the ArcKit version instead of the document version
- **Tech-note and vendor-profile templates missing status line** — added the `> **Template Status**: Live | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION] | **Command**: ...` blockquote to align with the other 48 templates
- **Health command always writes docs/health.json** — ensures dashboard integration works even when docs directory already exists

## [2.22.4] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Traceability hook missed FR and NFR requirements** — heading regex only matched h3 (`###`) but the requirements template uses h4 (`####`) for FR, NFR, INT, and DR sections; now matches both levels. Also changed the fallback from all-or-nothing to always-merge so regex-extracted IDs supplement heading matches instead of being silently skipped

## [2.22.3] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Pages directory tree** — moved RSCH from project root to `research/` subdirectory; added all 5 research types (RSCH, DSCT, AWRS, AZRS, GCRS) with sequence numbers to the directory tree
- **Health example filenames** — updated RSCH examples from `ARC-001-RSCH-v1.0.md` to `research/ARC-001-RSCH-001-v1.0.md`
- **Context hook missing vendor profiles and tech notes** — `arckit-context.mjs` now lists flat vendor profile files (`*-profile.md`) alongside vendor subdirectories, and scans `tech-notes/` directory so spawned knowledge from research is visible in project inventory

## [2.22.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Agent version detection Glob patterns** — all 5 research agents now include sequence number wildcard (`*-v*.md`) in Glob patterns for version detection, matching the multi-instance filename format (e.g., `ARC-001-RSCH-001-v1.0.md`)
- **Missing `research/` in Glob paths** — arckit-research and arckit-datascout version detection now searches `research/` subdirectory, matching where documents are actually written
- **Step numbering gaps** — fixed Step 11b → Step 11 in arckit-research (after 11a removal), fixed Step 17 → Step 16 in arckit-datascout (missing step)

## [2.22.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Removed VERSION file reads from 5 agents** — arckit-research, arckit-datascout, arckit-aws-research, arckit-azure-research, and arckit-gcp-research no longer instruct the agent to read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/VERSION`; the ArcKit version is already provided via the `arckit-context` SessionStart hook, eliminating unnecessary file reads (and failed `echo $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` attempts)
- **Removed VERSION file read from start command** — `/arckit:start` now uses the ArcKit version from context instead of reading the VERSION file

## [2.22.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Centralized doc type config** — single source of truth (`config/doc-types.mjs`) for all 49 document type codes, categories, multi-instance types, and subdirectory mappings. Replaces duplicated data across 5 hooks/templates
- **Research subdirectory routing** — all research types (RSCH, AWRS, AZRS, GCRS, DSCT) now auto-route to `research/` with sequence numbers (e.g., `ARC-001-RSCH-001-v1.0.md`)
- **`typeCategories` in manifest.json** — pages-template.html reads type-to-category mappings from the manifest instead of hardcoding them, staying in sync with the central config
- **New doc type codes** — GAPS (Gap Analysis, Governance), VEND (Vendor Evaluation, Procurement) added with full metadata

### Fixed

- **HLD/DLD example filenames** — `ARC-001-HLD` → `ARC-001-HLDR`, `ARC-001-DLD` → `ARC-001-DLDR` in hld-review and dld-review commands
- **DMC subdirectory** — `data-mesh-contracts/` → `data-contracts/` in data-mesh-contract command (4 occurrences)
- **DSCT category** — standardized to Discovery (was inconsistent between hooks)
- **PLAT category** — standardized to Architecture (was inconsistent between hooks)
- **DFD missing from pages** — added to type categories

### Changed

- **Hooks import from config** — validate-arc-filename, arckit-context, sync-guides, and update-manifest now import `DOC_TYPES`, `SUBDIR_MAP`, `KNOWN_TYPES`, `MULTI_INSTANCE_TYPES` from `config/doc-types.mjs` instead of defining inline copies
- **Subdirectory scan lists derived from config** — arckit-context, sync-guides, and update-manifest derive their subdirectory scan lists from `SUBDIR_MAP` instead of hardcoding them
- **Agents use inline filenames** — removed `generate-document-id.py` calls from all 5 research agents; they now use inline filename patterns and write directly to `research/`, with the PreToolUse hook as safety net

---

## [2.21.3] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Hook context not reaching Claude** — all 4 UserPromptSubmit hooks used `systemMessage` (which per docs is only "shown to user") instead of `additionalContext` (which is "added to Claude's context"). This caused Claude to ignore hook-injected instructions like "do not call tools" and redundantly read manifest.json. Switched to `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` in sync-guides, health-scan, traceability-scan, and arckit-context
- **Async hooks deliver context one turn late** — `arckit-context.mjs` and `arckit-session.mjs` had `"async": true`, meaning their `additionalContext` arrived on the next conversation turn instead of the current one. Removed async flag — both are fast filesystem scans that complete in < 1 second
- **Research stats missing from pages output** — added Research row to the stats table in sync-guides.mjs

---

## [2.21.2] - 2026-03-01

(Superseded by 2.21.3 — async fix was added after tagging)

---

## [2.21.1] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **PostToolUse manifest hook** — `update-manifest.mjs` incrementally updates `docs/manifest.json` after every ARC file write, keeping the manifest current without re-running `/arckit:pages`

### Fixed

- **Research files missing from manifest** — cloud research agents (aws-research, azure-research, gcp-research) write to `projects/*/research/` but `sync-guides.mjs` didn't scan that subdirectory. Added `research` to the subdirMap. Affected at least 3 test repos (v7, v17, v18)
- **UserPromptSubmit hooks read wrong field name** — all 5 hooks read `data.user_prompt` but the documented API field is `data.prompt`. Hooks silently got an empty string and exited. Fixed in arckit-context, sync-guides, health-scan, traceability-scan, and secret-detection
- **Hook guards reject Skill-expanded body** — `^` anchors on `isExpandedBody` regex failed when the Skill tool prefixed/wrapped the expanded command body. Removed anchors; unique `description:` strings prevent false positives. Also discovered that `UserPromptSubmit` matchers in hooks.json are silently ignored per the docs — the internal guard is the sole gating mechanism

---

## [2.21.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Traceability pre-processor hook** — automatically extracts requirements from project artifacts and computes coverage metrics before the traceability command runs

---

## [2.20.5] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Health hook fires for unrelated commands** — the `hooks.json` substring matcher triggers on any expanded command body that mentions `/arckit:health` or `/arckit:pages` (e.g. conformance, start, customize). Replaced naive regex guards with smart guards that match either the raw slash command or the Skill-expanded body's unique opening text (frontmatter description or heading). Applies to both `sync-guides.mjs` and `health-scan.mjs`.

---

## [2.20.4] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Pages command ignores hook stats and reads manifest** — removed all tools from `allowed-tools` (was `Read, Glob, Grep`), reformatted hook stats as a markdown table with explicit heading, and added triple-layered "do not call any tools" instructions to prevent the AI from second-guessing the hook's output.

---

## [2.20.3] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Hooks fail via Skill tool** — removed redundant `user_prompt` regex guards from `sync-guides.mjs` and `health-scan.mjs`. The `hooks.json` matcher already gates each hook; the internal guard silently aborted when the Skill tool passed the expanded command body instead of the raw slash command.

---

## [2.20.2] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **ANAL files missing from pages manifest** — removed Write from `/arckit:pages` allowed-tools so the AI cannot overwrite the hook-generated manifest; strengthened instruction to skip all tool use. Fixed ANAL category mismatch: `sync-guides.mjs` and `pages.md` reference table now map ANAL to Governance (matching `pages-template.html`).

---

## [2.20.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Analysis report type code** — standardized `ANLZ` → `ANAL` across all commands (analyze, health, story, service-assessment) and guides. Files named `ARC-*-ANLZ-*.md` were invisible to the manifest scanner and health hook because metadata tables only recognized `ANAL`.

---

## [2.20.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Health pre-processor hook** (`health-scan.mjs`) — new `UserPromptSubmit` hook pre-extracts all artifact metadata and applies all 7 detection rules (STALE-RSCH, FORGOTTEN-ADR, UNRESOLVED-COND, ORPHAN-REQ, MISSING-TRACE, VERSION-DRIFT, STALE-EXT) in Node.js, eliminating 20-50+ Read tool calls. The `/arckit:health` command now just formats the console output from hook findings.

---

## [2.19.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Pages pre-processor hook** — the `sync-guides` hook now handles the entire `/arckit:pages` pipeline (guide sync, title extraction, repo info, template processing, project scanning, manifest generation), reducing the command from ~310 tool calls to zero. The 134KB HTML template and ~95 guide files never enter the context window.

---

## [2.18.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Guide sync hook** (`sync-guides.mjs`) — new `UserPromptSubmit` hook replaces ~190 Read+Write tool round-trips in `/arckit:pages` with native `fs.copyFileSync`, mtime-based smart skipping, zero tool calls

---

## [2.17.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Tiered deviation classification** for conformance assessment — GREEN/YELLOW/RED tiers overlay on PASS/FAIL system, classifying FAIL findings by actionability: RED (escalate), YELLOW (negotiate), GREEN (acceptable) (#95)
- **Conversational gathering rules** (max 2 rounds) added to 15 commands for structured user input collection (#94)
- **STANDALONE/SUPERCHARGED degradation** for cloud research commands — graceful fallback when MCP servers are unavailable (#93)

---

## [2.16.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Quality checklist** (`references/quality-checklist.md`) — shared artifact verification with 10 common checks and 47 per-type checks keyed by document type code; introduces `references/` directory pattern (#92)
- **`argument-hint` frontmatter** on all 53 plugin commands — IDE-visible hints for required arguments

---

## [2.15.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **`allowed-tools` frontmatter** on all 53 plugin commands — explicit tool permissions per command for tighter security and predictability

### Fixed

- Replace Python script calls (`create-project.py`, `generate-document-id.py`, `list-projects.py`) with inline Glob/Write instructions in 20 commands — commands no longer shell out to scripts
- Remove `Bash` from `allowed-tools` in 50 commands that don't need it (down from 53 to only 3: `story`, `init`, `trello`)
- Markdown lint CI now recurses into subdirectories correctly
- Suppress MD038 false positive for intentional space-in-code-span in DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md

---

## [2.15.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Markdown linting CI** — markdownlint-cli2 configuration and GitHub Actions workflow enforcing consistent formatting across 571 markdown files; skills override for third-party reference docs

### Fixed

- Trailing whitespace, missing blank lines around headings/lists/fences, bare code fences, emphasis style inconsistencies across all commands, templates, guides, and agents

---

## [2.14.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Handoffs frontmatter** — 16 plugin commands now declare `handoffs:` in YAML frontmatter for machine-readable workflow navigation (requirements, stakeholders, risk, sobc, research, datascout, data-model, wardley, adr, sow, roadmap, aws/azure/gcp-research, strategy, backlog)
- **Release automation** — `scripts/generate-release-notes.sh` parses git log into Keep a Changelog sections; `.github/workflows/release.yml` creates GitHub Releases on tag push
- **Version automation** — `scripts/bump-version.sh` updates all 11 version files in one command

### Changed

- **Converter uses PyYAML** — `extract_frontmatter_and_prompt()` now uses `yaml.safe_load()` instead of regex, enabling parsing of complex frontmatter fields like `handoffs:`
- **Converter renders handoffs** — `render_handoffs_section()` appends a `## Suggested Next Steps` section to Codex/OpenCode/Gemini output for commands with handoffs
- **Config-driven converter** — refactored `scripts/converter.py` to use `AGENT_CONFIG` dictionary; adding a new AI target only requires a new dict entry

---

## [2.13.2] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Node.js hooks** — rewrote all 7 plugin hooks from Python to Node.js (.mjs) for Windows compatibility; `python3` doesn't exist on Windows but Node.js is guaranteed on every Claude Code installation (#86)
- Deleted 8 legacy `.py` hook files and 5 legacy `.sh` hook files (13 files removed)
- Added `async: true` to non-blocking hooks (arckit-session, arckit-context) for faster session start
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.13.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **Cross-platform commands** — removed bash-only patterns (`ls|sort|tail`, `mkdir -p`, `basename`, `sed`, `xargs`) from 7 commands (adr, customize, data-mesh-contract, init, pages, trello, wardley) replacing with Glob/Read/Write tool instructions
- **Cross-platform agents** — replaced `ls|sort -V|tail` version detection with Glob instructions and `generate-document-id.sh` references with `.py` across all 5 agents (research, aws-research, azure-research, gcp-research, datascout)
- **Wardley hook** — changed from bash to python3 for validate-wardley-math hook
- **Trello command** — added Windows PowerShell alternatives for environment variable checks
- **Migration guide** — added platform note that migrate-filenames.sh requires bash (Git Bash / WSL on Windows)
- Regenerated all Codex/OpenCode/Gemini formats via converter

---

## [2.13.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **NCSC Vulnerability Monitoring Service (VMS)** — `/arckit:secure` now assesses VMS enrollment in CAF C2 and includes a VMS Integration subsection (Section 6.1) with 8-day domain / 32-day general remediation benchmarks
- **Cyber Action Plan Alignment** (Section 9.4) — `/arckit:secure` template tracks departmental alignment with the £210m cross-government Cyber Action Plan across four pillars (Skills, Tooling, Resilience, Collaboration)
- **Government Cyber Security Profession** (Section 11) — `/arckit:secure` template assesses CCP certification, DDaT role mapping, Cyber Academy engagement, and workforce development planning
- **Structured vulnerability management** — `/arckit:operationalize` Section 11 expanded with 11.3 Vulnerability Scanning (VMS integration), 11.4 Remediation SLAs (severity-based + VMS benchmarks), and 11.5 Patch Management
- **Critical Vulnerability Remediation runbook** (6.7) — `/arckit:operationalize` template includes full runbook for critical CVEs and VMS alerts

### Changed

- `/arckit:secure` GovS 007 mapping updated: principle 5 (Security culture) references Cyber Security Profession, principle 8 (Continuous improvement) references Cyber Action Plan
- `/arckit:operationalize` handover checklist and NCSC guidance sections include VMS enrollment items
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.12.3] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Pages header: Repository icon** — replaced "Repository" text link with a GitHub icon positioned next to the dark/light mode toggle
- **Pages header: version badge** — added ArcKit version badge (`v{{VERSION}}`) to the header menu, populated from the plugin's VERSION file via new `{{VERSION}}` placeholder
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.12.2] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Pages template: GitHub Pages fallback** (#80) — relative paths (`../`) don't work on GitHub Pages because only the `/docs` folder is published; template now tries relative paths first (works for local/full-repo hosting), then falls back to `raw.githubusercontent.com` (works for GitHub Pages public repos)
- **New `{{CONTENT_BASE_URL}}` placeholder** — `/arckit:pages` command sets this to the raw.githubusercontent.com base URL for GitHub repos, enabling the fallback; non-GitHub hosting can set it to empty string

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.12.1] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Pages template: relative paths instead of GitHub raw URLs** (#79) — `docs/index.html` now loads documents via `../${path}` relative paths instead of `raw.githubusercontent.com`, making the site deployable to any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.)
- **Pages command: hosting-agnostic language** (#79) — description and summary updated from "GitHub Pages" to generic "documentation site" terminology with multi-provider deployment instructions
- **Pages error handling: safe DOM methods** (#79) — error display refactored from innerHTML to safe DOM construction (`createElement`/`textContent`), simplified to generic "Document not found" message
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.12.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **STALE-EXT detection rule for `/arckit:health`** (#77) — 7th detection rule flags external files in `external/` that are newer than a project's latest artifact, with filename-to-command mapping (e.g., `*api*` → `/arckit:requirements`, `/arckit:data-model`, `/arckit:diagram`) for targeted remediation
- **SessionStart hook external file detection** (#77) — auto-detects new external files at session start and reports them in context with project name and file count
- **UserPromptSubmit hook external file flagging** (#77) — context hook now marks external files as `(**NEW** — newer than latest artifact)` when they are newer than the project's most recent ARC-* artifact
- **PlantUML Syntax Reference skill** (`plantuml-syntax`) (#78) — 10 reference files covering C4-PlantUML (with layout conflict rules), sequence diagrams, class diagrams, activity diagrams, state diagrams, ER diagrams, component diagrams, use case diagrams, common syntax errors, and styling guide
- **C4-PlantUML layout conflict rules** (#78) — explicit rules preventing `Rel_Down`/`Lay_Right` contradictions: directional consistency, vertical consistency, all-pairs agreement, and coverage requirements with validation checklist
- **Format-specific syntax loading in `/arckit:diagram`** (#78) — Step 1d now conditionally loads PlantUML or Mermaid references based on selected output format; PlantUML format loads `c4-plantuml.md` with layout conflict rules
- **Mermaid ERD syntax rules in `/arckit:diagram`** (#78) — explicit rules preventing invalid `PK_FK` key type (must use `PK, FK` comma-separated); loads `entityRelationshipDiagram.md` reference for ER content

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.11.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **`/arckit.start` onboarding command** — guided entry point with project detection, tool survey, command decision tree, and context-aware workflow routing
- **Mermaid Syntax Reference skill** (`mermaid-syntax`) — 30 official Mermaid syntax reference files (auto-synced from [WH-2099/mermaid-skill](https://github.com/WH-2099/mermaid-skill)) covering all 23 diagram types plus configuration and theming, bundled with ArcKit's existing C4 layout science reference
  - 10 Mermaid-generating commands (`diagram`, `roadmap`, `plan`, `story`, `dfd`, `backlog`, `strategy`, `presentation`, `data-model`, `jsp-936`) now read type-specific syntax references before generating Mermaid code
  - Conversational skill triggers on Mermaid syntax questions (e.g., "what Mermaid diagram types can I use?", "gantt chart date format")

### Changed

- **Getting Started guide** now covers both `/arckit.start` and `/arckit.init` in a single combined guide with a quick-start section, replacing the previous start-only guide
- **GitHub Pages Getting Started section** updated with new steps 4 (`/arckit.start`) and 5 (`/arckit.init`) before the GDS phases workflow
- **`/arckit.pages` command** — added 5 missing guides to category and status tables: `start`, `conformance`, `productivity`, `remote-control`, `mcp-servers`
- Moved `c4-diagram-reference.md` from `templates/` to `skills/mermaid-syntax/references/c4-layout-science.md` — `/arckit.diagram` Step 1d path updated
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.10.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **DDaT Role Guides** (#75) — 18 new role-based guides mapping ArcKit commands to [UK Government DDaT Capability Framework](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/) roles, so users can find the commands relevant to their job
  - **Architecture** (7): Enterprise Architect, Solution Architect, Data Architect, Security Architect, Business Architect, Technical Architect, Network Architect
  - **Chief Digital and Data** (3): CTO/CDIO, CDO, CISO
  - **Product and Delivery** (4): Product Manager, Delivery Manager, Business Analyst, Service Owner
  - **Data** (2): Data Governance Manager, Performance Analyst
  - **IT Operations** (1): IT Service Manager
  - **Software Development** (1): DevOps Engineer
- Each guide includes primary commands, secondary commands, typical workflow, key artifacts, and related roles
- **"Roles" nav link** in GitHub Pages template — new top-level navigation alongside Dashboard and Guides
- `showRolesIndex()` function in pages template — renders role guides grouped by DDaT family with command counts
- Role guides added to search index in pages template
- `roleGuides` array in `manifest.json` schema — separate from command guides
- Updated `/arckit.pages` command to sync and index role guides from `docs/guides/roles/`

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.9.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Architecture Conformance Assessment** (`/arckit.conformance`) (#55) — new command for systematic decided-vs-designed conformance checking with 12 conformance rules: ADR decision implementation, cross-ADR consistency, superseded ADR enforcement, principles-to-design alignment, review condition resolution, exception register expiry/remediation, technology stack drift, architecture pattern drift, custom constraint rules (ArchCNL-style via `.arckit/conformance-rules.md`), known and untracked architecture technical debt
- New template: `conformance-assessment-template.md`
- New guide: `conformance.md`
- New doc type code: `CONF` (added to filename validation hook and context hook)
- Added `CONF` migration entry to `migrate-filenames.sh`
- Updated DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md with conformance row/column and critical paths

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.8.8] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Markdown escaping for `<` and `>` in generated documents** (#67) — added instruction to all 49 document-generating commands and 5 agents to space-separate less-than/greater-than comparisons (e.g., `< 3 seconds` instead of `<3 seconds`) so markdown renderers don't misinterpret them as HTML tags or emoji
- Fixed unescaped `<` examples in `requirements.md` and `servicenow.md`

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.8.7] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **PlantUML rendering in Pages** — `pages-template.html` now renders ` ```plantuml ``` ` code blocks as SVG diagrams via the PlantUML server (`plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/`), with interactive pan/zoom controls, dark mode support (CSS invert filter), fullscreen, scroll-to-zoom, keyboard shortcuts, and error fallback; no new JS dependencies required

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, Gemini extension, OpenCode extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.8.6] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Mermaid label compatibility for presentations** (#73, #70) — added ASCII-only, no-hyphens, no-special-characters rules to `/arckit.presentation` command, template, and guide; Mermaid's parser breaks on accented characters (é, í, ó) and hyphens in `quadrantChart` data point labels
- **Diagram command UX** (#71, #65) — `/arckit.diagram` now asks both diagram type and output format in a single `AskUserQuestion` call instead of sequentially; skip rules clarified for partial arguments

### Added

- **Mermaid Compatibility section** in presentation guide — documents label restrictions with troubleshooting advice
- **OpenCode extension guides** — MCP servers setup guide and Architecture Productivity Guide synced to OpenCode extension

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, Gemini extension, OpenCode extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.8.5] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **PlantUML C4 output format for `/arckit.diagram`** (#65) — C4 diagram types (Context, Container, Component) now offer PlantUML C4 as an alternative to Mermaid, with directional layout hints (`Rel_Right`, `Rel_Down`, `Lay_Right`, `Lay_Down`) for precise control on complex diagrams with more than 12 elements
- **Format selector** — interactive prompt (Question 2) lets users choose Mermaid or PlantUML C4 for C4 types; skip with `/arckit.diagram context plantuml`
- **PlantUML C4 examples** — Modes A, B, C include PlantUML examples alongside Mermaid
- **PlantUML syntax guidelines** — include URLs, element syntax, directional relationships, invisible layout constraints
- **PlantUML validation checks** — Step 5 validates directional variants, `Lay_Right`/`Lay_Down` constraints, `@startuml`/`@enduml` wrappers
- **Template PlantUML section** — architecture diagram template includes PlantUML code block, syntax reference, and directional hints quick-reference table
- **Guide update** — diagram guide includes format comparison table (Mermaid vs PlantUML) and PlantUML example
- **Platform support documentation** (#71) — README and docs/index.html note that ArcKit targets Linux, with devcontainer/WSL2 recommended for Windows
- **Pages template support for `/arckit:customize`** (#72) — users can now customize the pages HTML template

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, Gemini extension, OpenCode extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.8.4] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Interactive zoom/pan for Mermaid diagrams** — scroll to zoom, drag to pan, double-click to zoom in, toolbar controls (zoom-in, zoom-out, reset, fullscreen), keyboard shortcuts (`+`/`-`/`0`/`f`/`Escape`), and touch pinch-to-zoom via svg-pan-zoom library

---

## [2.8.3] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Dark mode for pages template** — CSS-variable-driven dark theme with sun/moon toggle in header, system preference detection (`prefers-color-scheme`), and localStorage persistence
- **Auto-sync guides from plugin** — `/arckit:pages` now copies all guides from the plugin to `docs/guides/` before scanning, ensuring repos always have the latest guides
- **4 missing guides synced to plugin** — `artifact-health`, `c4-layout-science`, `knowledge-compounding`, `security-hooks`

### Changed

- Replaced ~35 hardcoded colour values in pages template with semantic CSS variables
- Mermaid diagrams switch between default/dark theme based on mode
- SVG donut chart text colour reads from CSS variable for dark mode compatibility
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.8.2] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Health dashboard panel in `/arckit:pages`** — pages template loads `docs/health.json` (when present) and renders an Artifact Health panel with severity bars, findings-by-type breakdown, and a per-project Health column with traffic-light colours
- **`JSON=true` flag for `/arckit:health`** — writes machine-readable `docs/health.json` for dashboard integration alongside the console report

### Fixed

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **SessionStart hook for version injection** — new `hooks/arckit-session.sh` fires once at session start (and on resume/clear/compact), injecting the ArcKit plugin version into Claude's context and exporting `ARCKIT_VERSION` as an environment variable; also detects whether a `projects/` directory exists
- **OpenCode CLI support** — 4th distribution format (`arckit-opencode/`); `scripts/converter.py` now generates OpenCode markdown alongside Codex and Gemini formats

### Changed

- **Removed per-command VERSION file reads from 46 commands** — commands no longer instruct Claude to read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/VERSION`; the version is now provided via `{ARCKIT_VERSION}` from the SessionStart hook context, eliminating a redundant Read tool call on every command invocation
- Updated `hooks.json` to include `SessionStart` event alongside existing `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` hooks
- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.5.1] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **Removed `generate-document-id.sh` calls from 29 commands** — replaced bash script invocations with inline document ID format strings (e.g., `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-REQ-v{VERSION}`); the PreToolUse hook now auto-corrects ARC filenames, making script calls redundant. The script itself is retained for `arckit init` and standalone use.
- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **UserPromptSubmit hook for project context** — new `hooks/arckit-context.sh` hook automatically detects all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies before any `/arckit:` command runs, injecting structured context via `systemMessage`
- **Plugin hooks configuration** — new `hooks/hooks.json` firing `arckit-context.sh` on every `UserPromptSubmit` event (skips non-arckit and utility commands)
- **PreToolUse (Write) hook for filename enforcement** — new `hooks/validate-arc-filename.sh` auto-corrects ARC filenames before the Write tool creates them: zero-pads project IDs, normalizes version format, moves multi-instance types (ADR, DIAG, DFD, WARD, DMC) to correct subdirectories, assigns next sequence numbers, and blocks unknown doc type codes

### Changed

- **Refactored 39 commands to use hook-provided context** — removed boilerplate directory scanning, `ARC-*-TYPE-*.md` glob patterns, verbose external docs blocks, and `list-projects.sh` calls; replaced with compact hook-aware references (net -1,071 lines, 66% boilerplate reduction)
- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.4.5] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **New `/arckit:dfd` command** — Data Flow Diagram (DFD) generation with multi-instance support, document control, and DFD-specific template
- **DFD multi-instance document type** — `DFD` added to `generate-document-id.sh` for sequential numbering (ARC-001-DFD-001, ARC-001-DFD-002, etc.)

### Changed

- **Explicit VERSION file path in all commands and agents** — all 49 commands and 5 agents now reference `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/VERSION` instead of bare `VERSION`, ensuring the ArcKit version is always read from the plugin's authoritative file regardless of project state
- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.4.4] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **Windows cp1252 encoding fix** — added explicit `encoding='utf-8'` to all file I/O operations in `arckit init` to prevent `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows (fixes #49)

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.4.3] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Data Commons MCP server for Gemini extension** — added `datacommons-mcp` to the Gemini extension MCP configuration, matching the Claude plugin

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats (plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.4.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Data Commons MCP server** — bundled as a plugin MCP server for statistical data access (population, economics, health, etc.)

### Fixed

- Version bump to force plugin cache refresh for MCP server testing

---

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Gemini CLI native extension** — ArcKit is now available as a Gemini CLI extension at [`tractorjuice/arckit-gemini`](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini), giving Gemini users the same zero-config experience as the Claude Code plugin
  - Install: `gemini extensions install https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini`
  - Bundled MCP servers (AWS Knowledge, Microsoft Learn via mcp-remote), optional Google Developer Knowledge
  - All 48 commands, templates, scripts, guides, and Wardley Mapping skill included
  - Extension version tracks plugin version (v2.4.1)
- `scripts/converter.py` now generates extension output alongside Codex format, with path rewriting (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` -> `~/.gemini/extensions/arckit`)

### Fixed

- **Gemini extension workspace sandbox fix**: Extension commands prepend a file access instruction block telling the model to use `run_shell_command` instead of `read_file` for extension paths (Gemini CLI sandboxes `read_file` to the project directory). `Read` instructions are also rewritten to `cat` commands in extension output.

### Changed

- **CLI is now Codex-only**: Gemini CLI removed from the CLI package — Gemini users should use the native extension instead. The converter now generates 2 output formats (Codex + Extension) instead of 3.

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Google Cloud Research** (`/arckit:gcp-research`) — new command + agent for GCP-specific technology research using the [Google Developer Knowledge MCP](https://developerknowledge.googleapis.com/mcp) server

### Fixed

- Added explicit `list-projects.sh --json` step to 9 commands (stakeholders, requirements, adr, sow, roadmap, strategy, dpia, platform-design, data-mesh-contract) to prevent Claude from guessing wrong script paths in plugin-based repos that no longer have `.arckit/scripts/bash/`

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Wardley Mapping skill** (`skills/wardley-mapping/`) for conversational Wardley Mapping — quick questions, evolution stage lookups, doctrine assessments, and interactive map creation with AskUserQuestion
- 5 reference files shared between skill and `/arckit:wardley` command: evolution stages, doctrine, gameplay patterns, climatic patterns, and mapping examples

### Changed

- Renamed plugin commands to remove `arckit.` prefix for clean namespacing (e.g. `arckit.requirements` → `requirements`)
- Removed redundant MCP availability checks from AWS research commands (MCP now guaranteed by plugin)

## [2.1.3] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- Added missing `get_arckit_dir` and `get_templates_dir` functions to plugin `common.sh`
- Converted `arckit-init` from skill to slash command

## [2.1.2] - 2026-02-06

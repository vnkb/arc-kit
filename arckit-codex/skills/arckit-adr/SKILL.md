You are helping an enterprise architect create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) following MADR v4.0 format enhanced with UK Government requirements.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Instructions

> **Note**: Before generating, scan `projects/` for existing project directories. For each project, list all `ARC-*.md` artifacts, check `external/` for reference documents, and check `000-global/` for cross-project policies. If no external docs exist but they would improve output, ask the user.

### 1. **Read existing artifacts from the project context:**

**MANDATORY** (warn if missing):

- **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in 000-global)
  - Extract: Technology standards, constraints, compliance requirements that inform decision drivers
  - If missing: warn user to run `$arckit-principles` first
- **REQ** (Requirements)
  - Extract: BR/FR/NFR/INT/DR IDs that this decision addresses
  - If missing: warn user to run `$arckit-requirements` first

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):

- **RISK** (Risk Register)
  - Extract: Risks this decision mitigates, risk appetite context

**OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):

- **RSCH** (Research Findings) or **AWSR** / **AZUR** (Cloud Research)
  - Extract: Options already analyzed, vendor comparisons, TCO data
- **STKE** (Stakeholder Analysis)
  - Extract: Stakeholder goals, decision authority, RACI context
- **WARD** (Wardley Map)
  - Extract: Evolution stage influences on build vs buy choices

### 1b. **Read external documents and policies**

- Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract previous architectural decisions, decision rationale, options considered, decision outcomes
- Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract enterprise decision frameworks, architecture review board templates, cross-project decision logs
- If no external docs exist but they would improve context, ask: "Do you have any previous ADRs from legacy systems or decision logs? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

### 1c. **Interactive Configuration**

Before creating the ADR, use the **AskUserQuestion** tool to gather key decision parameters. **Skip any question where the user has already provided a clear answer in their arguments.**

**Gathering rules** (apply to all questions in this section):

- Ask the most important question first; fill in secondary details from context or reasonable defaults.
- **Maximum 2 rounds of questions.** After that, pick the best option from available context.
- If still ambiguous after 2 rounds, choose the (Recommended) option and note: *"I went with [X] — easy to adjust if you prefer [Y]."*

**Question 1** — header: `Escalation`, multiSelect: false
> "What escalation level does this architectural decision require?"

- **Team**: Local implementation decision (frameworks, libraries, testing approaches)
- **Cross-team**: Affects multiple teams (integration patterns, shared services, APIs)
- **Department (Recommended)**: Department-wide impact (technology standards, cloud providers, security frameworks)
- **Cross-government**: National infrastructure or cross-department interoperability

**Question 2** — header: `Options`, multiSelect: false
> "How many options should be evaluated (plus a 'Do Nothing' baseline)?"

- **3 options (Recommended)**: Standard analysis — Do Nothing + 2 alternatives provides clear comparison
- **2 options**: Quick decision — Do Nothing + 1 proposed approach for straightforward choices
- **4+ options**: Comprehensive analysis — Do Nothing + 3+ alternatives for complex technology selections

Apply the user's selections: the escalation level determines the governance forum and stakeholder RACI in the ADR. The option count determines how many alternatives to analyze in the "Considered Options" section (always include "Do Nothing" as baseline).

### 2. **Identify the target project**

- Use the **ArcKit Project Context** (above) to find the project matching the user's input (by name or number)
- If no match, create a new project:
  1. Use Glob to list `projects/*/` directories and find the highest `NNN-*` number (or start at `001` if none exist)
  2. Calculate the next number (zero-padded to 3 digits, e.g., `002`)
  3. Slugify the project name (lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with hyphens, trim)
  4. Use the Write tool to create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/README.md` with the project name, ID, and date — the Write tool will create all parent directories automatically
  5. Also create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/external/README.md` with a note to place external reference documents here
  6. Set `PROJECT_ID` = the 3-digit number, `PROJECT_PATH` = the new directory path

### 3. **Create decisions directory and determine ADR number**

- Use Glob to find existing `projects/{project-slug}/decisions/ADR-*.md` files
- If none found, the next ADR number is `ADR-001`
- If found, extract the highest ADR number and increment by 1 (e.g., `ADR-003` → `ADR-004`), zero-padded to 3 digits
- The decisions directory will be created automatically when saving the file with the Write tool

### 4. **Read the template** (with user override support)

- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/adr-template.md` exists in the project root
- **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
- **If not found**: Read `.arckit/templates/adr-template.md` (default)

   > **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `$arckit-customize adr`

### 5. **Gather decision information from user**

- **Decision title**: Short noun phrase (e.g., "Use PostgreSQL for Data Persistence")
- **Problem statement**: What architectural decision needs to be made?
- **Context**: Why is this decision needed? Business/technical drivers?
- **Status**: Proposed (default) / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
- **Escalation level**: Team / Cross-team / Department / Cross-government
- **Governance forum**: Architecture Review Board, TDA, Programme Board, etc.

### 6. **Generate comprehensive ADR** following MADR v4.0 + UK Gov framework

   **Document Control** (see "Auto-Populate Document Control Fields" section below for full details):

- Document ID: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ADR-{NUM}-v{VERSION}` (e.g., `ARC-001-ADR-001-v1.0`)
- ADR Number: ADR-{NUM} (e.g., ADR-001, ADR-002)
- Version: ${VERSION} (from Step 0: Detect Version)
- Status: Proposed (or as user specified)
- Date: Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Escalation Level: Based on decision scope
- Governance Forum: Based on escalation level

   **Stakeholders**:

- **Deciders**: Who has authority to approve this ADR?
- **Consulted**: Subject matter experts to involve (two-way communication)
- **Informed**: Stakeholders to keep updated (one-way communication)
- **UK Government Escalation Context**:
  - Team: Local implementation (frameworks, libraries, testing)
  - Cross-team: Integration patterns, shared services, APIs
  - Department: Technology standards, cloud providers, security
  - Cross-government: National infrastructure, cross-department interoperability

   **Context and Problem Statement**:

- Problem description (2-3 sentences or story format)
- Why is this decision needed?
- Business context (link to BR-xxx requirements)
- Technical context (link to FR-xxx, NFR-xxx requirements)
- Regulatory context (GDPR, GDS Service Standard, Cyber Essentials)
- Supporting links (user stories, requirements, research)

   **Decision Drivers (Forces)**:

- **Technical drivers**: Performance, scalability, maintainability, security
  - Link to NFR-xxx requirements
  - Reference architecture principles

  - NCSC Cyber Security (Cyber Essentials, CAF principles)
  - Data Protection (UK GDPR Article 25, 35)
- **Alignment to architecture principles**: Create table showing which principles support/conflict

   **Considered Options** (MINIMUM 2-3 options, always include "Do Nothing"):

   For each option:

- **Description**: What is this option?
- **Implementation approach**: How would it be implemented?
- **Wardley Evolution Stage**: Genesis / Custom-Built / Product / Commodity
- **Good (Pros)**:
  - ✅ Benefits, requirements met, principles supported
  - ✅ Quantify where possible (performance, cost savings)
- **Bad (Cons)**:
  - ❌ Drawbacks, requirements not met, risks
  - ❌ Trade-offs and negative consequences
- **Cost Analysis**:
  - CAPEX: One-time costs (licenses, hardware, migration)
  - OPEX: Ongoing costs (support, training, maintenance per year)
  - TCO (3-year): Total cost of ownership
- **GDS Service Standard Impact**: Create table showing impact on relevant points

   **Option: Do Nothing (Baseline)**:

- Always include this as baseline comparison
- Pros: No immediate cost, no risk
- Cons: Technical debt accumulates, opportunity cost, compliance risk

   **Decision Outcome**:

- **Chosen Option**: Which option was selected
- **Y-Statement** (structured justification):
     > In the context of [use case],
     > facing [concern],
     > we decided for [option],
     > to achieve [quality/benefit],
     > accepting [downside/trade-off].
- **Justification**: Why this option over alternatives?
  - Key reasons with evidence
  - Stakeholder consensus or dissenting views
  - Risk appetite alignment

   **Consequences**:

- **Positive**: Benefits, capabilities enabled, compliance achieved
  - Include measurable outcomes (metrics: baseline → target)
- **Negative**: Accepted trade-offs, limitations, technical debt
  - Include mitigation strategies
- **Neutral**: Changes needed (training, infrastructure, process, vendors)
- **Risks and Mitigations**: Create table with risk, likelihood, impact, mitigation, owner
  - Link to risk register (RISK-xxx)

   **Validation & Compliance**:

- **How will implementation be verified?**
  - Design review requirements (HLD, DLD include this decision)

### 7. **Ensure comprehensive traceability**

- Link decision drivers to requirements (BR-xxx, FR-xxx, NFR-xxx)
- Link to architecture principles (show alignment/conflicts)
- Link to stakeholder goals (from ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-STKE-v*.md)
- Link to risk mitigations (from ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-RISK-v*.md)
- Link to research findings (which sections analyzed these options)
- Link to Wardley maps (evolution stage influences choice)
- Link to roadmap (which theme/initiative this supports)
- Create bidirectional traceability chain

### 8. **Create file naming**

- **Format**: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ADR-{NUM}-v{VERSION}.md`
- **Example**: `ARC-001-ADR-001-v1.0.md`, `ARC-001-ADR-002-v1.0.md`
- **Path**: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}-{project-name}/decisions/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ADR-{NUM}-v{VERSION}.md`
- Sequence number auto-assigned from existing files in the directory

Before writing the file, read `.arckit/references/quality-checklist.md` and verify all **Common Checks** plus the **ADR** per-type checks pass. Fix any failures before proceeding.

### 9. **Use Write tool to create the ADR file**

- **CRITICAL**: Because ADRs are very large documents (500+ lines), you MUST use the Write tool to create the file
- Do NOT output the full ADR content in your response (this will exceed token limits)
- Use Write tool with the full ADR content
- Path: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}-{project-name}/decisions/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ADR-{NUM}-v${VERSION}.md`

**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

### Step 0: Detect Version

Before generating the document ID, check if a previous version exists:

ADRs are multi-instance documents. Version detection depends on whether you are creating a **new** ADR or **updating** an existing one:

**Creating a new ADR** (default): Use `VERSION="1.0"` — the ADR number is auto-incremented by `--next-num`.

**Updating an existing ADR** (user explicitly references an existing ADR number, e.g., "update ADR-001", "revise ADR-003"):

1. Look for existing `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ADR-{NUM}-v*.md` files in `projects/{project-dir}/decisions/`
2. **If no existing file**: Use VERSION="1.0"
3. **If existing file found**:
   - Read the existing document to understand its current state
   - Compare against current inputs and the decision being made
   - **Minor increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1): Status change, updated evidence, corrected details, same decision outcome
   - **Major increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 2.0): Decision outcome changed, options re-evaluated, fundamentally different justification
4. Use the determined version for document ID, filename, Document Control, and Revision History
5. For v1.1+/v2.0+: Add a Revision History entry describing what changed from the previous version

### Step 1: Construct Document ID

- **Document ID**: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ADR-{NNN}-v{VERSION}` (e.g., `ARC-001-ADR-001-v1.0`)
- Sequence number `{NNN}`: Check existing files in `decisions/` and use the next number (001, 002, ...)

### Step 2: Populate Required Fields

**Auto-populated fields** (populate these automatically):

- `[PROJECT_ID]` → Extract from project path (e.g., "001" from "projects/001-project-name")
- `[VERSION]` → Determined version from Step 0
- `[DATE]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME]` → "Architecture Decision Record"
- `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-ADR-[NUM]-v[VERSION]` → Construct using format from Step 1
- `[COMMAND]` → "arckit.adr"

**User-provided fields** (extract from project metadata or user input):

- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Full project name from project metadata or user input
- `[OWNER_NAME_AND_ROLE]` → Document owner (prompt user if not in metadata)
- `[CLASSIFICATION]` → Default to "OFFICIAL" for UK Gov, "PUBLIC" otherwise (or prompt user)

**Calculated fields**:

- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Current date + 30 days (requirements, research, risks)
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Phase gate dates (Alpha/Beta/Live for compliance docs)

**Pending fields** (leave as [PENDING] until manually updated):

- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to "Project Team, Architecture Team" or [PENDING]

### Step 3: Populate Revision History

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `$arckit-adr` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

### Step 4: Populate Generation Metadata Footer

The footer should be populated with:

```markdown
**Generated by**: ArcKit `$arckit-adr` command
**Generated on**: {DATE} {TIME} GMT
**ArcKit Version**: {ARCKIT_VERSION}
**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME} (Project {PROJECT_ID})
**AI Model**: [Use actual model name, e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"]
**Generation Context**: [Brief note about source documents used]
```

### Example Fully Populated Document Control Section

```markdown
## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Document ID** | ARC-001-ADR-003-v1.0 |
| **Document Type** | Architecture Decision Record |

|---------|------|--------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 1.0 | 2025-10-29 | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `$arckit-adr` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

### 10. **Show summary to user** (NOT full document)

   ```markdown
   ## Architecture Decision Record Created

   **ADR Number**: ADR-{NUM}
   **Title**: {Decision title}
   **Status**: {Proposed/Accepted/etc}
   **File**: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}-{project-name}/decisions/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ADR-{NUM}-v${VERSION}.md`

   ### Chosen Option
   {Option name}

   ### Y-Statement
   > In the context of {use case},
   > facing {concern},
   > we decided for {option},
   > to achieve {quality},
   > accepting {downside}.

   ### Options Considered
   - Option 1: {Name} - {Brief summary}
   - Option 2: {Name} - {Brief summary}
   - Option 3: Do Nothing - Baseline comparison

   ### Key Consequences
   **Positive**:
   - {Benefit 1}
   - {Benefit 2}

   **Negative** (accepted trade-offs):
   - {Trade-off 1}
   - {Trade-off 2}

   ### Decision Drivers
   - {Driver 1}: {Brief description}
   - {Driver 2}: {Brief description}

   ### Requirements Addressed
   - BR-XXX: {Business requirement}
   - FR-XXX: {Functional requirement}
   - NFR-XXX: {Non-functional requirement}

   ### Traceability Links
   - Architecture principles: {Count} principles referenced
   - Stakeholder goals: {Count} goals supported
   - Requirements: {Count} requirements addressed
   - Risks: {Count} risks mitigated

   ### Next Steps
   - [ ] Stakeholder review and approval
   - [ ] Update status to "Accepted" once approved
   - [ ] Reflect decision in HLD/DLD
   - [ ] Update architecture diagrams
   - [ ] Implement decision
   - [ ] Verify with testing
   - [ ] Schedule ADR review ({Date})

   ### UK Government Compliance
   **Escalation Level**: {Level}
   **Governance Forum**: {Forum}
   **GDS Service Standard**: Points {X, Y, Z} addressed
   **Technology Code of Practice**: Points {A, B, C} addressed
   ```

### 11. **Provide guidance on ADR lifecycle**

- **Status transitions**:
  - Proposed → Accepted (after approval)
  - Accepted → Superseded (when replaced by new ADR)
  - Accepted → Deprecated (when no longer recommended but not replaced)
- **When to create new ADR**:
  - Significant architectural decision affecting structure, behavior, or quality attributes
  - Technology choices (databases, frameworks, cloud services, APIs)
  - Integration patterns and protocols
  - Security and compliance approaches
  - Deployment and infrastructure decisions
  - Data management and privacy decisions
- **When NOT to create ADR**:
  - Minor implementation details (variable names, coding style)
  - Temporary workarounds or fixes
  - Decisions that don't affect other teams or systems
- **ADR numbering**:
  - Sequential: ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003, etc.
  - Never reuse numbers (even if ADR is superseded)
  - Superseded ADRs remain in place with updated status

## Important Notes

- **Token Limit**: ADRs are very large documents. Always use Write tool to create the file, never output full content
- **Minimum Options**: Always analyze at least 2-3 options plus "Do Nothing" baseline
- **Y-Statement**: This is the concise justification format - always include it
- **Traceability**: Every ADR must link to requirements, principles, stakeholders, risks
- **UK Government**: Include escalation level and governance forum for compliance
- **MADR Format**: Follow MADR v4.0 structure (Context, Decision Drivers, Options, Outcome, Consequences)
- **Evidence-Based**: Decisions should be supported by research findings, benchmarks, PoCs
- **Wardley Evolution**: Consider evolution stage (Genesis/Custom/Product/Commodity) when choosing options
- **GDS Service Standard**: Document which Service Standard points the decision addresses
- **Technology Code of Practice**: Show TCoP compliance (Point 5: Cloud first, Point 8: Reuse, etc.)
- **Security**: Include NCSC guidance, Cyber Essentials, security testing requirements
- **Review Schedule**: Every ADR needs review schedule and trigger events for re-evaluation
- **Rollback Plan**: Document how to rollback if decision proves wrong
- **Cost Analysis**: Always include CAPEX, OPEX, TCO for each option
- **Consequences**: Be explicit about both positive and negative consequences
- **Validation**: Define how implementation will be verified (review, testing, monitoring)

- **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

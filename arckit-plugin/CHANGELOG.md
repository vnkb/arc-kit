and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

---

## [2.13.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **Cross-platform commands** — removed bash-only patterns (`ls|sort|tail`, `mkdir -p`, `basename`, `sed`, `xargs`) from 7 commands (adr, customize, data-mesh-contract, init, pages, trello, wardley) replacing with Glob/Read/Write tool instructions
- **Cross-platform agents** — replaced `ls|sort -V|tail` version detection with Glob instructions and `generate-document-id.sh` references with `.py` across all 5 agents (research, aws-research, azure-research, gcp-research, datascout)
- **Wardley hook** — changed from bash to python3 for validate-wardley-math hook
- **Trello command** — added Windows PowerShell alternatives for environment variable checks
- **Migration guide** — added platform note that migrate-filenames.sh requires bash (Git Bash / WSL on Windows)
- Regenerated all Codex/OpenCode/Gemini formats via converter

---

## [2.13.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **NCSC Vulnerability Monitoring Service (VMS)** — `/arckit:secure` now assesses VMS enrollment in CAF C2 and includes a VMS Integration subsection (Section 6.1) with 8-day domain / 32-day general remediation benchmarks
- **Cyber Action Plan Alignment** (Section 9.4) — `/arckit:secure` template tracks departmental alignment with the £210m cross-government Cyber Action Plan across four pillars (Skills, Tooling, Resilience, Collaboration)
- **Government Cyber Security Profession** (Section 11) — `/arckit:secure` template assesses CCP certification, DDaT role mapping, Cyber Academy engagement, and workforce development planning
- **Structured vulnerability management** — `/arckit:operationalize` Section 11 expanded with 11.3 Vulnerability Scanning (VMS integration), 11.4 Remediation SLAs (severity-based + VMS benchmarks), and 11.5 Patch Management
- **Critical Vulnerability Remediation runbook** (6.7) — `/arckit:operationalize` template includes full runbook for critical CVEs and VMS alerts

### Changed

- `/arckit:secure` GovS 007 mapping updated: principle 5 (Security culture) references Cyber Security Profession, principle 8 (Continuous improvement) references Cyber Action Plan
- `/arckit:operationalize` handover checklist and NCSC guidance sections include VMS enrollment items
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.12.3] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Pages header: Repository icon** — replaced "Repository" text link with a GitHub icon positioned next to the dark/light mode toggle
- **Pages header: version badge** — added ArcKit version badge (`v{{VERSION}}`) to the header menu, populated from the plugin's VERSION file via new `{{VERSION}}` placeholder
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.12.2] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Pages template: GitHub Pages fallback** (#80) — relative paths (`../`) don't work on GitHub Pages because only the `/docs` folder is published; template now tries relative paths first (works for local/full-repo hosting), then falls back to `raw.githubusercontent.com` (works for GitHub Pages public repos)
- **New `{{CONTENT_BASE_URL}}` placeholder** — `/arckit:pages` command sets this to the raw.githubusercontent.com base URL for GitHub repos, enabling the fallback; non-GitHub hosting can set it to empty string

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.12.1] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Pages template: relative paths instead of GitHub raw URLs** (#79) — `docs/index.html` now loads documents via `../${path}` relative paths instead of `raw.githubusercontent.com`, making the site deployable to any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.)
- **Pages command: hosting-agnostic language** (#79) — description and summary updated from "GitHub Pages" to generic "documentation site" terminology with multi-provider deployment instructions
- **Pages error handling: safe DOM methods** (#79) — error display refactored from innerHTML to safe DOM construction (`createElement`/`textContent`), simplified to generic "Document not found" message
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.12.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **STALE-EXT detection rule for `/arckit:health`** (#77) — 7th detection rule flags external files in `external/` that are newer than a project's latest artifact, with filename-to-command mapping (e.g., `*api*` → `/arckit:requirements`, `/arckit:data-model`, `/arckit:diagram`) for targeted remediation
- **SessionStart hook external file detection** (#77) — auto-detects new external files at session start and reports them in context with project name and file count
- **UserPromptSubmit hook external file flagging** (#77) — context hook now marks external files as `(**NEW** — newer than latest artifact)` when they are newer than the project's most recent ARC-* artifact
- **PlantUML Syntax Reference skill** (`plantuml-syntax`) (#78) — 10 reference files covering C4-PlantUML (with layout conflict rules), sequence diagrams, class diagrams, activity diagrams, state diagrams, ER diagrams, component diagrams, use case diagrams, common syntax errors, and styling guide
- **C4-PlantUML layout conflict rules** (#78) — explicit rules preventing `Rel_Down`/`Lay_Right` contradictions: directional consistency, vertical consistency, all-pairs agreement, and coverage requirements with validation checklist
- **Format-specific syntax loading in `/arckit:diagram`** (#78) — Step 1d now conditionally loads PlantUML or Mermaid references based on selected output format; PlantUML format loads `c4-plantuml.md` with layout conflict rules
- **Mermaid ERD syntax rules in `/arckit:diagram`** (#78) — explicit rules preventing invalid `PK_FK` key type (must use `PK, FK` comma-separated); loads `entityRelationshipDiagram.md` reference for ER content

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

- **Mermaid Syntax Reference skill** (`mermaid-syntax`) — 30 official Mermaid syntax reference files (auto-synced from [WH-2099/mermaid-skill](https://github.com/WH-2099/mermaid-skill)) covering all 23 diagram types plus configuration and theming, bundled with ArcKit's existing C4 layout science reference
  - 10 Mermaid-generating commands (`diagram`, `roadmap`, `plan`, `story`, `dfd`, `backlog`, `strategy`, `presentation`, `data-model`, `jsp-936`) now read type-specific syntax references before generating Mermaid code
  - Conversational skill triggers on Mermaid syntax questions (e.g., "what Mermaid diagram types can I use?", "gantt chart date format")

### Changed

- **Getting Started guide** now covers both `/arckit.start` and `/arckit.init` in a single combined guide with a quick-start section, replacing the previous start-only guide
- **GitHub Pages Getting Started section** updated with new steps 4 (`/arckit.start`) and 5 (`/arckit.init`) before the GDS phases workflow
- **`/arckit.pages` command** — added 5 missing guides to category and status tables: `start`, `conformance`, `productivity`, `remote-control`, `mcp-servers`
- Moved `c4-diagram-reference.md` from `templates/` to `skills/mermaid-syntax/references/c4-layout-science.md` — `/arckit.diagram` Step 1d path updated
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.10.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **DDaT Role Guides** (#75) — 18 new role-based guides mapping ArcKit commands to [UK Government DDaT Capability Framework](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/) roles, so users can find the commands relevant to their job

- Each guide includes primary commands, secondary commands, typical workflow, key artifacts, and related roles
- **"Roles" nav link** in GitHub Pages template — new top-level navigation alongside Dashboard and Guides
- `showRolesIndex()` function in pages template — renders role guides grouped by DDaT family with command counts
- Role guides added to search index in pages template
- `roleGuides` array in `manifest.json` schema — separate from command guides
- Updated `/arckit.pages` command to sync and index role guides from `docs/guides/roles/`

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.9.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

---

## [2.8.8] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Markdown escaping for `<` and `>` in generated documents** (#67) — added instruction to all 49 document-generating commands and 5 agents to space-separate less-than/greater-than comparisons (e.g., `< 3 seconds` instead of `<3 seconds`) so markdown renderers don't misinterpret them as HTML tags or emoji
- Fixed unescaped `<` examples in `requirements.md` and `servicenow.md`

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.8.7] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **PlantUML rendering in Pages** — `pages-template.html` now renders ` ```plantuml ``` ` code blocks as SVG diagrams via the PlantUML server (`plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/`), with interactive pan/zoom controls, dark mode support (CSS invert filter), fullscreen, scroll-to-zoom, keyboard shortcuts, and error fallback; no new JS dependencies required

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, Gemini extension, OpenCode extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.8.6] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Mermaid label compatibility for presentations** (#73, #70) — added ASCII-only, no-hyphens, no-special-characters rules to `/arckit.presentation` command, template, and guide; Mermaid's parser breaks on accented characters (é, í, ó) and hyphens in `quadrantChart` data point labels
- **Diagram command UX** (#71, #65) — `/arckit.diagram` now asks both diagram type and output format in a single `AskUserQuestion` call instead of sequentially; skip rules clarified for partial arguments

### Added

- **Mermaid Compatibility section** in presentation guide — documents label restrictions with troubleshooting advice
- **OpenCode extension guides** — MCP servers setup guide and Architecture Productivity Guide synced to OpenCode extension

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, Gemini extension, OpenCode extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.8.5] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **PlantUML C4 output format for `/arckit.diagram`** (#65) — C4 diagram types (Context, Container, Component) now offer PlantUML C4 as an alternative to Mermaid, with directional layout hints (`Rel_Right`, `Rel_Down`, `Lay_Right`, `Lay_Down`) for precise control on complex diagrams with more than 12 elements
- **Format selector** — interactive prompt (Question 2) lets users choose Mermaid or PlantUML C4 for C4 types; skip with `/arckit.diagram context plantuml`
- **PlantUML C4 examples** — Modes A, B, C include PlantUML examples alongside Mermaid
- **PlantUML syntax guidelines** — include URLs, element syntax, directional relationships, invisible layout constraints
- **PlantUML validation checks** — Step 5 validates directional variants, `Lay_Right`/`Lay_Down` constraints, `@startuml`/`@enduml` wrappers
- **Template PlantUML section** — architecture diagram template includes PlantUML code block, syntax reference, and directional hints quick-reference table
- **Guide update** — diagram guide includes format comparison table (Mermaid vs PlantUML) and PlantUML example

- **Auto-sync guides from plugin** — `/arckit:pages` now copies all guides from the plugin to `docs/guides/` before scanning, ensuring repos always have the latest guides
- **4 missing guides synced to plugin** — `artifact-health`, `c4-layout-science`, `knowledge-compounding`, `security-hooks`

### Changed

- Replaced ~35 hardcoded colour values in pages template with semantic CSS variables
- Mermaid diagrams switch between default/dark theme based on mode
- SVG donut chart text colour reads from CSS variable for dark mode compatibility
- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.8.2] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Health dashboard panel in `/arckit:pages`** — pages template loads `docs/health.json` (when present) and renders an Artifact Health panel with severity bars, findings-by-type breakdown, and a per-project Health column with traffic-light colours
- **`JSON=true` flag for `/arckit:health`** — writes machine-readable `docs/health.json` for dashboard integration alongside the console report

### Fixed

- Version bump across all distribution formats

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **UK Government Cyber Security Standard integration** — `/arckit.secure` template now includes three new sections for CSS compliance (July 2025, Cabinet Office):

- **National Data Strategy reference guide** — new `docs/guides/national-data-strategy.md` mapping NDS 5 missions and 4 pillars to ArcKit commands and artefacts, with pillar checklists and National Data Library context
- NDS added to UK Government standards map (Mermaid diagram, lifecycle table, reference links)
- NDS cross-reference added to data-model command, template, and guide
- **Government Data Quality Framework reference guide** — new `docs/guides/data-quality-framework.md` mapping DQF 5 principles, 6 dimensions, 4 practical tools, maturity model, and data lifecycle to ArcKit artefacts
- DQF alignment note added to data-model template's existing Data Quality Framework section
- DQF cross-reference added to data-model command and guide
- **UK Government Codes of Practice reference guide** — new `docs/guides/codes-of-practice.md` mapping the Rainbow of Books (Magenta, AQuA, Rose, Commercial Playbooks) alongside existing Green/Orange Book coverage to ArcKit commands, with delivery lifecycle mapping

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **SessionStart hook for version injection** — new `hooks/arckit-session.sh` fires once at session start (and on resume/clear/compact), injecting the ArcKit plugin version into Claude's context and exporting `ARCKIT_VERSION` as an environment variable; also detects whether a `projects/` directory exists
- **OpenCode CLI support** — 4th distribution format (`arckit-opencode/`); `scripts/converter.py` now generates OpenCode markdown alongside Codex and Gemini formats

### Changed

- **Removed per-command VERSION file reads from 46 commands** — commands no longer instruct Claude to read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/VERSION`; the version is now provided via `{ARCKIT_VERSION}` from the SessionStart hook context, eliminating a redundant Read tool call on every command invocation
- Updated `hooks.json` to include `SessionStart` event alongside existing `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` hooks
- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.5.1] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **Removed `generate-document-id.sh` calls from 29 commands** — replaced bash script invocations with inline document ID format strings (e.g., `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-REQ-v{VERSION}`); the PreToolUse hook now auto-corrects ARC filenames, making script calls redundant. The script itself is retained for `arckit init` and standalone use.
- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **UserPromptSubmit hook for project context** — new `hooks/arckit-context.sh` hook automatically detects all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies before any `/arckit:` command runs, injecting structured context via `systemMessage`
- **Plugin hooks configuration** — new `hooks/hooks.json` firing `arckit-context.sh` on every `UserPromptSubmit` event (skips non-arckit and utility commands)
- **PreToolUse (Write) hook for filename enforcement** — new `hooks/validate-arc-filename.sh` auto-corrects ARC filenames before the Write tool creates them: zero-pads project IDs, normalizes version format, moves multi-instance types (ADR, DIAG, DFD, WARD, DMC) to correct subdirectories, assigns next sequence numbers, and blocks unknown doc type codes

### Changed

- **Refactored 39 commands to use hook-provided context** — removed boilerplate directory scanning, `ARC-*-TYPE-*.md` glob patterns, verbose external docs blocks, and `list-projects.sh` calls; replaced with compact hook-aware references (net -1,071 lines, 66% boilerplate reduction)
- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.4.5] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **New `/arckit:dfd` command** — Data Flow Diagram (DFD) generation with multi-instance support, document control, and DFD-specific template
- **DFD multi-instance document type** — `DFD` added to `generate-document-id.sh` for sequential numbering (ARC-001-DFD-001, ARC-001-DFD-002, etc.)

### Changed

- **Explicit VERSION file path in all commands and agents** — all 49 commands and 5 agents now reference `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/VERSION` instead of bare `VERSION`, ensuring the ArcKit version is always read from the plugin's authoritative file regardless of project state
- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.4.4] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **Windows cp1252 encoding fix** — added explicit `encoding='utf-8'` to all file I/O operations in `arckit init` to prevent `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows (fixes #49)

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats (CLI, plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.4.3] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Data Commons MCP server for Gemini extension** — added `datacommons-mcp` to the Gemini extension MCP configuration, matching the Claude plugin

### Changed

- Version bump across all distribution formats (plugin, extension, marketplace)

---

## [2.4.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Data Commons MCP server** — bundled as a plugin MCP server for statistical data access (population, economics, health, etc.)

### Fixed

- Version bump to force plugin cache refresh for MCP server testing

---

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Gemini CLI native extension** — ArcKit is now available as a Gemini CLI extension at [`tractorjuice/arckit-gemini`](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini), giving Gemini users the same zero-config experience as the Claude Code plugin
  - Install: `gemini extensions install https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini`
  - Bundled MCP servers (AWS Knowledge, Microsoft Learn via mcp-remote), optional Google Developer Knowledge
  - All 48 commands, templates, scripts, guides, and Wardley Mapping skill included
  - Extension version tracks plugin version (v2.4.1)
- `scripts/converter.py` now generates extension output alongside Codex format, with path rewriting (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` -> `~/.gemini/extensions/arckit`)

### Fixed

- **Gemini extension workspace sandbox fix**: Extension commands prepend a file access instruction block telling the model to use `run_shell_command` instead of `read_file` for extension paths (Gemini CLI sandboxes `read_file` to the project directory). `Read` instructions are also rewritten to `cat` commands in extension output.

### Changed

- **CLI is now Codex-only**: Gemini CLI removed from the CLI package — Gemini users should use the native extension instead. The converter now generates 2 output formats (Codex + Extension) instead of 3.

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Google Cloud Research** (`/arckit:gcp-research`) — new command + agent for GCP-specific technology research using the [Google Developer Knowledge MCP](https://developerknowledge.googleapis.com/mcp) server

  - UK Government: G-Cloud procurement, europe-west2 (London) data residency, NCSC alignment
  - Cost optimization: Committed Use Discounts (CUDs), Sustained Use Discounts (SUDs), Spot VMs, E2 machine types
  - IaC: Terraform (primary), Cloud Build CI/CD pipelines
  - Doc type code: `GCRS`
- Added `google-developer-knowledge` MCP server to plugin `.mcp.json` (requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` env var)
- Added GCP research template, guide, and dependency matrix entry

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- Pass directory argument to `--next-num` in multi-instance commands (wardley, diagram, data-mesh-contract) to prevent unbound variable crash with `set -u`
- Added guard in `generate-document-id.sh` to give a clear error message when directory is missing
- Replace Mermaid `gitGraph` with `flowchart` in devops template — gitGraph has limited renderer support and fails with "No diagram type detected" errors in GitHub/VS Code
- Added diagram guidelines to devops command to prevent gitGraph usage in generated documents

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Mathematical models** for Wardley Mapping skill — new `references/mathematical-models.md` with evolution scoring formulas, decision metrics (differentiation pressure, commodity leverage, dependency risk), and weak signal detection framework
- Quantitative analysis triggers in skill description (score evolution, calculate ubiquity, differentiation pressure, commodity leverage, weak signal detection, readiness score)
- Optional **Step 6: Quantitative Analysis** in SKILL.md mapping workflow
- Numeric scoring rubric (ubiquity/certainty scales) added to `references/evolution-stages.md`
- Quantitative positioning worked example added to E-Commerce Platform in `references/mapping-examples.md`

---

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- Added explicit `list-projects.sh --json` step to 9 commands (stakeholders, requirements, adr, sow, roadmap, strategy, dpia, platform-design, data-mesh-contract) to prevent Claude from guessing wrong script paths in plugin-based repos that no longer have `.arckit/scripts/bash/`

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Wardley Mapping skill** (`skills/wardley-mapping/`) for conversational Wardley Mapping — quick questions, evolution stage lookups, doctrine assessments, and interactive map creation with AskUserQuestion
- 5 reference files shared between skill and `/arckit:wardley` command: evolution stages, doctrine, gameplay patterns, climatic patterns, and mapping examples
- Enhanced strategic analysis in `/arckit:wardley` command — now reads shared reference files for doctrine assessment, gameplay patterns, climatic patterns, and mapping examples
- Output documents now include Doctrine Assessment Summary, Applicable Gameplay Patterns, and Climatic Pattern Analysis sections

## [2.1.9] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- Interactive configuration using AskUserQuestion for 8 key commands: backlog, diagram, plan, adr, dpia, sow, sobc, roadmap
- Commands now ask users about key decision points (prioritization approach, diagram type, contract type, evaluation weighting, etc.) before generating documents
- Questions are automatically skipped when users specify preferences via command arguments

## [2.1.8] - 2026-02-07

### Removed

- Redundant SessionStart hook that checked for already-bundled MCP servers (AWS Knowledge + Microsoft Learn are guaranteed by plugin `.mcp.json`)

## [2.1.7] - 2026-02-07

### Changed

- Plugin is now the **sole Claude Code distribution** — CLI no longer ships `.claude/commands/` or `.claude/agents/`
- All 22 test repos migrated from synced files to plugin marketplace

## [2.1.5] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- Bundled Microsoft Learn MCP server (`https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`) via `.mcp.json`

### Changed

- Removed redundant MCP availability checks from Azure research commands (MCP now guaranteed by plugin)

## [2.1.4] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- Bundled AWS Knowledge MCP server (`https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws`) via `.mcp.json`

### Changed

- Renamed plugin commands to remove `arckit.` prefix for clean namespacing (e.g. `arckit.requirements` → `requirements`)
- Removed redundant MCP availability checks from AWS research commands (MCP now guaranteed by plugin)

## [2.1.3] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- Added missing `get_arckit_dir` and `get_templates_dir` functions to plugin `common.sh`
- Converted `arckit-init` from skill to slash command

## [2.1.2] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- Removed `hooks` field from `plugin.json` (auto-discovered from `hooks/` directory)

## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- Reference agents by name in commands instead of `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` workaround
- Removed `agents` field from `plugin.json` (auto-discovered from `agents/` directory)
- Removed invalid `color`, `permissionMode`, `tools` fields from agent frontmatter (invalid in plugin context)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- Initial plugin release for Claude Code marketplace
- 46 slash commands for architecture governance artifact generation
- 4 autonomous agents (research, datascout, aws-research, azure-research)
- 35 document templates with Document Control standard
- Helper scripts (`common.sh`, `create-project.sh`, `generate-document-id.sh`, etc.)
- Command usage guides
- `marketplace.json` for plugin discovery
- MIT LICENSE

### Changed

- All commands use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for template and script references
- Agent frontmatter uses only valid plugin fields (`name`, `description`, `model`)

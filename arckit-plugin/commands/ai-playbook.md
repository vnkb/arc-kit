## Instructions

> **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

1. **Identify AI system context**:
   - AI system name and purpose
   - Type of AI (Generative, Predictive, Computer Vision, NLP, etc.)
   - Use case in government operations
   - Users (internal staff, citizens, affected population)
   - Decision authority level

2. **Determine risk level**:

**HIGH-RISK AI** (requires strictest oversight):

- Fully automated decisions affecting:
  - Health and safety
  - Fundamental rights
  - Access to services
  - Legal status
  - Employment
  - Financial circumstances
- Examples: Benefit eligibility, immigration decisions, medical diagnosis, predictive policing

**MEDIUM-RISK AI** (significant impact with human oversight):

- Semi-automated decisions with human review
- Significant resource allocation
- Examples: Case prioritization, fraud detection scoring, resource allocation

**LOW-RISK AI** (productivity/administrative):

- Recommendation systems with human control
- Administrative automation
- Examples: Email categorization, meeting scheduling, document summarization

3. **Read existing artifacts from the project context:**

   **MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
   - **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in 000-global)
     - Extract: AI/ML governance standards, technology constraints, compliance requirements
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:principles` first
   - **REQ** (Requirements)
     - Extract: AI/ML-related FR requirements, NFR (security, compliance, fairness), DR (data requirements)
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:requirements` first

   **RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
   - **DATA** (Data Model)
     - Extract: Training data sources, personal data, special category data, data quality
   - **RISK** (Risk Register)
     - Extract: AI-specific risks, bias risks, security risks, mitigation strategies

   **OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):
   - **STKE** (Stakeholder Analysis)
     - Extract: Affected populations, decision authority, accountability
   - **DPIA** (Data Protection Impact Assessment)
     - Extract: Data protection context, lawful basis, privacy risks

   **Read the template** (with user override support):
   - **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/uk-gov-ai-playbook-template.md` exists in the project root
   - **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
   - **If not found**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/uk-gov-ai-playbook-template.md` (default)

   > **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize ai-playbook`

4. **Read external documents and policies**:
   - Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract AI ethics policies, model cards, algorithmic impact assessments, bias testing results
   - Read any **global policies** listed in the project context (`000-global/policies/`) — extract AI governance framework, approved AI/ML platforms, responsible AI guidelines
   - Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract enterprise AI strategy, responsible AI frameworks, cross-project AI maturity assessments
   - If no external docs exist but they would improve the output, ask: "Do you have any AI governance policies, model cards, or ethical AI assessments? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

5. **Assess the 10 Core Principles**:

### Principle 1: Understanding AI

- Team understands AI limitations (no reasoning, contextual awareness)
- Realistic expectations (hallucinations, biases, edge cases)
- Appropriate use case for AI capabilities

### Principle 2: Lawful and Ethical Use

- **CRITICAL**: DPIA, EqIA, Human Rights assessment completed
- UK GDPR compliance
- Equality Act 2010 compliance
- Data Ethics Framework applied
- Legal/compliance team engaged early

### Principle 3: Security

- Cyber security assessment (NCSC guidance)
- AI-specific threats assessed:
  - Prompt injection
  - Data poisoning
  - Model theft
  - Adversarial attacks

## Example Usage

User: `/arckit:ai-playbook Assess AI Playbook compliance for benefits eligibility chatbot using GPT-4`

You should:

- Identify system: Benefits eligibility chatbot, Generative AI (LLM)
- Determine risk: **HIGH-RISK** (affects access to benefits - fundamental right)
- Assess 10 principles:
  - 1. Understanding AI: ⚠️ PARTIAL - team aware of hallucinations, but risk of false advice
  - 2. Lawful/Ethical: ❌ NON-COMPLIANT - DPIA not yet completed (BLOCKING)
  - 3. Security: ✅ COMPLIANT - prompt injection defenses, content filtering
  - 4. Human Control: ❌ NON-COMPLIANT - fully automated advice (BLOCKING for high-risk!)
  - 5. Lifecycle: ✅ COMPLIANT - monitoring, retraining schedule defined
  - 6. Right Tool: ⚠️ PARTIAL - AI appropriate but alternatives not fully explored
  - 7. Collaboration: ✅ COMPLIANT - engaged with GDS, DWP
  - 8. Commercial: ✅ COMPLIANT - OpenAI contract includes audit rights
  - 9. Skills: ✅ COMPLIANT - multidisciplinary team
  - 10. Organizational: ✅ COMPLIANT - SRO assigned, governance in place
- Assess 6 ethical themes:
  - 1. Safety: ⚠️ PARTIAL - content filtering but some harmful outputs in testing
  - 2. Transparency: ❌ NON-COMPLIANT - ATRS not yet published (MANDATORY)
  - 3. Fairness: ⚠️ PARTIAL - bias testing started, gaps in demographic coverage
  - 4. Accountability: ✅ COMPLIANT - clear ownership, audit trail
  - 5. Contestability: ❌ NON-COMPLIANT - no human review process (BLOCKING)
  - 6. Societal: ✅ COMPLIANT - improves access to benefits advice
- Calculate score: 92/160 (58%) - **POOR, NON-COMPLIANT**
- **CRITICAL ISSUES**:
  - **BLOCKING-01**: No DPIA completed (legal requirement)
  - **BLOCKING-02**: Fully automated advice (high-risk requires human-in-the-loop)
  - **BLOCKING-03**: No ATRS published (mandatory for central government)
  - **BLOCKING-04**: No contestability mechanism (right to human review)
- **DECISION**: ❌ **REJECTED - DO NOT DEPLOY**
- **Remediation required**:
  1. Complete DPIA immediately
  2. Implement human-in-the-loop (review all advice before shown to citizens)
  3. Publish ATRS
  4. Create contestability process
  5. Re-assess after remediation
- Write to `projects/NNN-benefits-chatbot/ARC-NNN-AIPB-v1.0.md`
- **Summary**: "HIGH-RISK AI system with 4 blocking issues. Cannot deploy until ALL principles met."

## Important Notes

- AI Playbook is **MANDATORY** guidance for all UK government AI systems
- HIGH-RISK AI cannot deploy without meeting ALL principles
- ATRS publication is MANDATORY for central government
- DPIAs are MANDATORY for AI processing personal data
- Human oversight is REQUIRED for high-risk decisions
- Non-compliance can result in legal challenges, ICO fines, public backlash
- "Move fast and break things" does NOT apply to government AI
- When in doubt, err on side of caution (add more safeguards)

- **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

You are helping a UK government organization create an Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS) record for an AI or algorithmic tool.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Instructions

> **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

1. **Understand ATRS requirements**:
   - ATRS is **MANDATORY** for all central government departments and arm's length bodies
   - Two-tier structure: Tier 1 (public summary) + Tier 2 (detailed technical)
   - Published records on GOV.UK repository
   - Must be clear, accurate, and comprehensive

2. **Identify the algorithmic tool**:
   - Tool name and purpose
   - Type of algorithm (rule-based, ML, generative AI, etc.)
   - Government function (benefits, healthcare, policing, etc.)
   - Current phase (pre-deployment, beta, production, retired)
   - Users (staff and/or citizens)

3. **Determine risk level** (similar to AI Playbook):
   - **HIGH-RISK**: Automated decisions affecting rights, benefits, legal status, healthcare
   - **MEDIUM-RISK**: Semi-automated with human review, significant resource allocation
   - **LOW-RISK**: Administrative, productivity tools, recommendations with human control

4. **Read existing artifacts from the project context:**

   **MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
   - **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in 000-global)
     - Extract: AI governance standards, technology constraints, compliance requirements
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:principles` first
   - **REQ** (Requirements)
     - Extract: AI/ML-related FR requirements, NFR (security, fairness), DR (data requirements)
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:requirements` first

   **RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
   - **AIPB** (AI Playbook Assessment)
     - Extract: Risk level, human oversight model, ethical assessment scores, gaps

   **OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):
   - **DATA** (Data Model)
     - Extract: Training data sources, personal data, data quality, storage
   - **DPIA** (Data Protection Impact Assessment)
     - Extract: Data protection assessment, lawful basis, privacy risks

   **Read the template** (with user override support):
   - **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/uk-gov-atrs-template.md` exists in the project root
   - **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
   - **If not found**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/uk-gov-atrs-template.md` (default)

   > **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize atrs`

5. **Read external documents and policies**:
   - Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract previous ATRS submissions, algorithmic impact assessments, model documentation, fairness testing results
   - Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract organization-wide algorithmic transparency policies, AI ethics frameworks, cross-project ATRS standards
   - If no external docs exist but they would improve the record, ask: "Do you have any existing ATRS records from similar systems or algorithmic documentation? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

6. **Complete TIER 1 - Summary Information** (for general public):

## Important Notes

- ATRS publication is **MANDATORY** for central government
- Records must be published on GOV.UK ATRS repository: https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records
- ATRS is PUBLIC - do not include sensitive information (security vulnerabilities, personal data, commercially sensitive details)
- Use plain English in Tier 1 - imagine explaining to a family member
- Tier 2 should be detailed enough for technical scrutiny
- Update ATRS record when significant changes occur (new version, scope change, incidents)
- Regular reviews required (annually minimum, quarterly for high-risk)
- Contact algorithmic-transparency@dsit.gov.uk for guidance

- **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

## Related Frameworks

- **AI Playbook** - responsible AI deployment (use `/arckit:ai-playbook` first for AI systems)
- **Technology Code of Practice** - broader technology governance (use `/arckit:tcop`)
- **Data Ethics Framework** - responsible data use
- **GDS Service Standard** - service design and delivery

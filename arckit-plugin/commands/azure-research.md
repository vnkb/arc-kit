# Azure Technology Research

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Instructions

This command performs Azure-specific technology research using the Microsoft Learn MCP server to match project requirements to Azure services, architecture patterns, Well-Architected guidance, Security Benchmark controls, and UK Government compliance.

**This command delegates to the `arckit-azure-research` agent** which runs as an autonomous subprocess. The agent makes 15-30+ MCP calls (microsoft_docs_search, microsoft_docs_fetch, microsoft_code_sample_search) to gather authoritative Azure documentation — running in its own context window to avoid polluting the main conversation with large documentation chunks.

### What to Do

1. **Determine the project**: If the user specified a project name/number, note it. Otherwise, identify the most recent project in `projects/`.

2. **Launch the agent**: Launch the **arckit-azure-research** agent in `acceptEdits` mode with the following prompt:

   ```text
   Research Azure services and architecture patterns for the project in projects/{project-dir}/.

   User's additional context: {$ARGUMENTS}

   Follow your full process: read requirements, research Azure services per category, Well-Architected assessment, Security Benchmark mapping, UK Government compliance, cost estimation, write document, return summary.
   ```

3. **Report the result**: When the agent completes, relay its summary to the user.

### Alternative: Direct Execution

If the Task tool is unavailable or the user prefers inline execution, fall back to the full research process:

1. Check prerequisites (requirements document must exist)
2. **Read the template** (with user override support):
   - **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/azure-research-template.md` exists in the project root
   - **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
   - **If not found**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/azure-research-template.md` (default)

   - **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize azure-research`
3. Extract Azure service needs from requirements (compute, data, integration, security, AI/ML)
4. Use MCP tools for each category: service discovery, deep dive, architecture patterns, Well-Architected assessment, Security Benchmark mapping, code samples
5. UK Government: G-Cloud, UK South/West data residency, NCSC compliance
6. Cost estimation with optimization (Reserved Instances, Azure Hybrid Benefit, Spot VMs)
7. Generate Mermaid architecture diagram
8. Write to `projects/{project-dir}/research/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-AZRS-v1.0.md` using Write tool
9. Show summary only (not full document)

### Output

The agent writes the full research document to file and returns a summary including:

- Azure services recommended per category
- Architecture pattern and reference
- Security alignment (Security Benchmark, Well-Architected)
- UK Government suitability (G-Cloud, UK regions, classification)
- Estimated monthly cost
- Next steps (`/arckit:diagram`, `/arckit:secure`, `/arckit:devops`)

## Integration with Other Commands

- **Input**: Requires requirements document (`ARC-*-REQ-*.md`)
- **Input**: Uses data model (`ARC-*-DATA-*.md`) for database selection
- **Output**: Feeds into `/arckit:diagram` (Azure-specific diagrams)
- **Output**: Feeds into `/arckit:secure` (validates against Secure by Design)
- **Output**: Feeds into `/arckit:devops` (Azure DevOps pipeline design)
- **Output**: Feeds into `/arckit:finops` (Azure cost management strategy)

$ARGUMENTS
```

## Goal

Generate a comprehensive compliance assessment document that measures adherence to each architecture principle defined in `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md`. The assessment includes RAG status (Red/Amber/Green), evidence links, gaps, and actionable recommendations.

**This is a point-in-time assessment** - run at key project gates (Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live) to track compliance over time.

## Prerequisites

### Architecture Principles (MANDATORY)

a. **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in `projects/000-global/`) (MUST exist):

- If NOT found: ERROR "Run /arckit:principles first to define governance standards for your organization"
- Principles compliance cannot be assessed without defined principles

### Project Artifacts (RECOMMENDED)

More artifacts = better evidence = more accurate assessment:

- **REQ** (Requirements) in `projects/{project-dir}/` - Requirements to assess against principles
- `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/hld-v*.md` - High-Level Design
- `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/dld-v*.md` - Detailed Low-Level Design
- **TCOP** (TCoP Assessment) in `projects/{project-dir}/` - Technology Code of Practice compliance
- **SECD** (Secure by Design) in `projects/{project-dir}/` - Security assessment
- **DATA** (Data Model) in `projects/{project-dir}/` - Data architecture
- **TRAC** (Traceability Matrix) in `projects/{project-dir}/` - Requirements traceability

**Note**: Assessment is possible with minimal artifacts, but accuracy improves with more evidence.

## Operating Constraints

**Non-Destructive Assessment**: Do NOT modify existing artifacts. Generate a new assessment document only.

**Dynamic Principle Extraction**: Do NOT assume a fixed number of principles. Organizations may define 5, 10, 20, or more principles. Extract ALL principles found in `ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` dynamically.

**Evidence-Based Assessment**: RAG status must be justified by concrete evidence (file references, section numbers, line numbers). Avoid vague statements like "design addresses this" - be specific.

**Honest Assessment**: Do not inflate scores. AMBER is better than false GREEN. RED principles require immediate attention or exception approval.

## Execution Steps

> **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

### 0. Read the Template

**Read the template** (with user override support):

- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/principles-compliance-assessment-template.md` exists in the project root
- **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
- **If not found**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/principles-compliance-assessment-template.md` (default)

> **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize principles-compliance`

### 1. Validate Prerequisites

**Check Architecture Principles**:

```bash
if [ ! -f projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md ]; then
    ERROR "Architecture principles not found. Run /arckit:principles first."
fi
```

### 1b. Read external documents and policies

- Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract audit findings, compliance gaps, certification evidence, remediation plans
- Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract enterprise compliance frameworks, audit standards, cross-project compliance benchmarks
- If no external docs exist but they would improve the compliance assessment, ask: "Do you have any external audit findings or compliance certificates? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

### 2. Extract All Principles Dynamically

Read any `ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` file in `projects/000-global/` and extract ALL principles found.

**Extraction Pattern**:

Principles are typically structured as:

```markdown
### [Number]. [Principle Name]

**Principle Statement**:
[Statement text]

**Rationale**:
[Rationale text]

**Implications**:
- [Implication 1]
- [Implication 2]

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Gate 1
- [ ] Gate 2
- [ ] Gate 3
```

**For EACH principle found**:

- Extract principle number (optional - may not exist)
- Extract principle name/title (REQUIRED)
- Extract principle statement (REQUIRED)
- Extract rationale (REQUIRED)
- Extract implications (OPTIONAL)
- Extract validation gates (OPTIONAL - but highly valuable for assessment)

**Important**: Do NOT hardcode principle names or count. Organizations customize their principles. Extract dynamically whatever exists in the file.

**Example Extraction**:

```text
Principle 1: "Scalability and Elasticity"
Principle 2: "Resilience and Fault Tolerance"
Principle 3: "Security by Design"
...
[However many principles are defined]
```

### 3. Identify the target project

- Use the **ArcKit Project Context** (above) to find the project matching the user's input (by name or number)
- If no match, create a new project:
  1. Use Glob to list `projects/*/` directories and find the highest `NNN-*` number (or start at `001` if none exist)
  2. Calculate the next number (zero-padded to 3 digits, e.g., `002`)
  3. Slugify the project name (lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with hyphens, trim)
  4. Use the Write tool to create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/README.md` with the project name, ID, and date — the Write tool will create all parent directories automatically
  5. Also create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/external/README.md` with a note to place external reference documents here
  6. Set `PROJECT_ID` = the 3-digit number, `PROJECT_PATH` = the new directory path

### 4. Load Project Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the information needed for assessment. Do NOT read entire files - extract relevant sections.

**From any `ARC-*-REQ-*.md` file in `projects/{project-dir}/`** (if exists):

- Business requirements (BR-xxx) count and examples
- Functional requirements (FR-xxx) count and examples
- Non-functional requirements by category:
  - Security (NFR-SEC-xxx or NFR-S-xxx)
  - Performance (NFR-P-xxx)
  - Scalability (NFR-S-xxx)
  - Compliance (NFR-C-xxx)
  - Accessibility (NFR-A-xxx)
- Integration requirements (INT-xxx) count
- Data requirements (DR-xxx) count

**From `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/hld-v*.md`** (if exists):

- Table of contents or section headings
- Architecture overview section
- Technology stack / technology choices
- Security architecture section
- Deployment model (cloud provider, regions, availability zones)
- Integration patterns (APIs, events, messaging)
- Data architecture section
- Observability/monitoring approach

**From `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/dld-v*.md`** (if exists):

- Detailed component design
- API specifications
- Infrastructure as Code references
- Testing strategy
- CI/CD pipeline description

**From compliance assessments** (if exist):

- `ARC-*-TCOP-*.md` - TCoP point scores
- `ARC-*-SECD-*.md` - NCSC CAF assessment results
- `ARC-*-SECD-MOD-*.md` - MOD CAAT assessment
- `ARC-*-AIPB-*.md` - AI principles scores
- `ARC-*-ATRS-*.md` - Algorithmic transparency

**From other artifacts**:

- Any `ARC-*-DATA-*.md` file - Entity-relationship diagram, GDPR compliance
- Any `ARC-*-TRAC-*.md` file - Requirements coverage
- `ARC-*-SNOW-*.md` - Operational design
- Any `ARC-*-STKE-*.md` file - Business drivers
- Any `ARC-*-RISK-*.md` file - Risk mitigation plans

### 5. Assess Each Principle

**FOR EACH principle extracted** from ARC-000-PRIN-*.md:

#### A. Evidence Search

Look for evidence of compliance in project artifacts:

**Requirements Evidence**:

- Does ARC-*-REQ-*.md address this principle?
- Are there specific requirements (BR/FR/NFR) supporting this principle?
- Example: Security principle → Check for NFR-SEC-xxx requirements

**Design Evidence**:

- Does HLD/DLD demonstrate implementation of this principle?
- Are there design decisions explicitly addressing this principle?
- Example: Scalability principle → Check for auto-scaling, load balancing in HLD

**Validation Gates Evidence**:

- For each validation gate defined in the principle, check if satisfied
- Example: "Load testing demonstrates capacity growth" → Look for test results

**Compliance Assessment Evidence**:

- Do compliance assessments (TCoP, Secure by Design) validate this principle?
- Example: Security principle → Check ARC-*-SECD-*.md findings

#### B. RAG Status Assignment

Assign ONE of these statuses:

**🔴 RED (Non-Compliant)**:

- Principle is directly VIOLATED (design contradicts principle)
- No evidence of compliance AND no plan to comply
- Critical gaps with no remediation plan

**Criteria for RED**:

- Design explicitly violates principle (e.g., manual deployment when IaC principle exists)
- Security principle violated with no compensating controls
- No requirements or design addressing critical principle

**🟠 AMBER (Partial Compliance)**:

- Some evidence exists (typically requirements acknowledge principle)
- Design addresses principle but implementation gaps remain
- Clear remediation path defined with target dates
- "Principle in progress" - work underway but incomplete

**Criteria for AMBER**:

- Requirements exist but design incomplete
- Design exists but implementation/testing incomplete
- Some validation gates passed, others failed
- Gaps identified with remediation plan

**🟢 GREEN (Fully Compliant)**:

- Strong evidence across MULTIPLE artifacts (requirements + design + tests/assessments)
- Most or all validation gates satisfied
- No significant gaps identified

**Criteria for GREEN**:

- Requirements clearly address principle
- Design demonstrates implementation
- Validation evidence exists (tests, assessments, operational metrics)
- All or most validation gates passed

**⚪ NOT ASSESSED (Insufficient Evidence)**:

- Project too early in lifecycle (Discovery phase, no requirements yet)
- Artifacts needed for assessment don't exist yet
- Principle applies to later phases (e.g., operational principles before Go-Live)

**Criteria for NOT ASSESSED**:

- Project phase too early (Discovery with no requirements)
- Principle requires implementation evidence but only requirements exist
- Assessment deferred to later gate by design

#### C. Gap Identification

**If AMBER or RED** - identify specific gaps:

For each gap:

- **Description**: What's missing?
- **Impact**: What risk does this gap create?
- **Evidence Missing**: What artifact/proof is absent?
- **Remediation**: How can this gap be closed?
- **Owner**: Who should remediate? (suggest role)
- **Target Date**: When should this be fixed? (next gate)

**Example Gap**:

```text
Gap: No load testing performed
Impact: Cannot validate system meets performance requirements under load
Evidence Missing: Load test results, performance metrics
Remediation: Conduct load testing with 10,000 concurrent users per NFR-P-001
Owner: Performance Engineer
Target Date: Before Beta gate (2025-02-15)
```

#### D. Recommendations

Generate actionable next steps:

**For RED principles**:

- IMMEDIATE actions required before proceeding to next gate
- OR exception request process if compliance impossible
- Assign clear ownership and deadlines

**For AMBER principles**:

- Actions to achieve GREEN status before next gate
- Evidence gathering needed (tests, threat models, etc.)
- Track in project backlog with target dates

**For GREEN principles**:

- How to maintain compliance (continuous monitoring)
- Next reassessment trigger (phase change, major design change)

**For NOT ASSESSED principles**:

- When to reassess (which gate/phase)
- What artifacts needed before assessment possible

### 6. Generate Assessment Document

Use the **Write tool** to create:
`projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-PRCO-v1.0.md`

**Document Structure** (see template below)

**IMPORTANT**: Use Write tool, not output to user. Document will be 500-2000 lines depending on:

- Number of principles (varies by organization)
- Number of artifacts available (more artifacts = more evidence)
- Number of gaps identified (RED/AMBER principles = more detail)

### 7. Show Summary to User

Display concise summary (NOT full document):

```text

[IF no validation gates defined:]
- ⚪ No validation gates defined for this principle in ARC-000-PRIN-*.md

---

#### Assessment: [🔴🟠🟢⚪]

**Status Justification**:

[FOR 🟢 GREEN - Example:]
This principle is **fully compliant** with strong evidence:
- Requirements clearly define {requirement type} addressing principle (NFR-{XXX}-{NNN})
- HLD Section {N} demonstrates implementation approach with {technology/pattern}
- {Validation evidence} confirms principle satisfaction
- {N} of {M} validation gates passed
- No significant gaps identified

[FOR 🟠 AMBER - Example:]
This principle is **partially compliant** with gaps identified:
- Requirements acknowledge principle ({N} requirements found)
- HLD describes approach (Section {N}) but implementation incomplete
- {Validation gates} not yet satisfied
- Clear remediation path defined (see Gaps section)
- Expected to achieve GREEN by {next gate} phase

[FOR 🔴 RED - Example:]
This principle is **violated** or non-compliant:
- HLD Section {N} describes {approach} which directly contradicts principle requirement for {expected approach}
- No requirements addressing this mandatory principle
- No remediation plan found
- No exception request submitted
- **CRITICAL**: Requires immediate remediation or CTO/CIO exception approval

[FOR ⚪ NOT ASSESSED - Example:]
This principle **cannot be assessed** at current project phase:
- Project currently in {phase} phase
- Principle requires {artifact type} which doesn't exist yet
- Assessment deferred to {next phase} gate
- Expected artifacts: {list}
- No concerns at this stage - timing appropriate

**Gap {#}: {Gap Title}**
- **Description**: {What is missing or wrong}
- **Impact**: {Business/technical risk this gap creates}
- **Evidence Missing**: {What artifact/proof is absent}
- **Severity**: [CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
- **Remediation**: {Specific actions to close gap}
- **Responsible**: {Suggested role - e.g., "Solution Architect", "Security Engineer"}
- **Target Date**: {Next gate date or specific date}
- **Dependencies**: {What else needs to happen first}

[Example:]
**Gap 1: No load testing performed**
- **Description**: System scalability not validated under load. NFR-P-001 requires support for 10,000 concurrent users, but no load test performed.
- **Impact**: Risk of production performance failure. Cannot validate auto-scaling configuration works as designed.
- **Evidence Missing**: Load test results, performance metrics under stress
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Remediation**:
  1. Define load test scenarios based on NFR-P requirements
  2. Execute load tests using {tool suggestion based on stack}
  3. Validate auto-scaling triggers at 70% CPU threshold (per HLD Section 5.2)
  4. Document results and update compliance assessment
- **Responsible**: Performance Engineer / QA Lead
- **Target Date**: Before Beta gate review (2025-02-15)
- **Dependencies**: Auto-scaling configuration must be deployed to test environment

[IF NO GAPS:]
✅ No gaps identified - principle fully satisfied

---

## Appendix: Assessment Methodology

### RAG Status Criteria

**🟢 GREEN (Fully Compliant)**:
- Evidence in multiple artifact types (requirements + design + implementation/validation)
- Most or all validation gates satisfied
- No significant gaps identified
- Principle demonstrably satisfied with proof

**🟠 AMBER (Partial Compliance)**:
- Some evidence exists (typically requirements or design)
- Clear gaps identified but remediation plan exists
- Work in progress with target completion dates
- Path to GREEN status clear and achievable

**🔴 RED (Non-Compliant)**:
- Principle directly violated by design decisions
- No evidence of compliance and no plan to comply
- Critical gaps with no remediation plan
- Requires immediate attention or exception approval

**⚪ NOT ASSESSED (Insufficient Evidence)**:
- Project phase too early for meaningful assessment
- Required artifacts don't exist yet (by design)
- Assessment deferred to appropriate later gate
- No concern - timing appropriate for project phase

### Evidence Types

**Primary Evidence** (strongest):
- Requirements with acceptance criteria (NFR requirements especially strong)
- Design documentation with specific technical decisions
- Implementation artifacts (IaC code, configs, CI/CD pipelines)
- Test results (load tests, pen tests, security scans)
- Operational metrics (monitoring dashboards, SLA reports)

**Secondary Evidence** (supporting):
- Compliance assessments (TCoP, Secure by Design, AI Playbook)
- Architecture diagrams showing principle implementation
- Traceability matrices linking requirements to design
- Stakeholder requirements driving principle adherence

**Weak Evidence** (insufficient alone):
- Aspirational statements without implementation details
- "We plan to..." without concrete requirements or design
- Vague references without file:section:line specificity

### Validation Approach

For each principle:
1. **Extract** principle definition and validation gates from ARC-000-PRIN-*.md
2. **Search** for evidence across all available project artifacts
3. **Link** evidence to specific files, sections, and line numbers
4. **Assess** validation gates (pass/fail/n/a for each)
5. **Assign** RAG status based on evidence strength and validation coverage
6. **Identify** gaps where evidence is weak or missing
7. **Recommend** specific actions to achieve GREEN status

## Post-Generation Actions

After generating the assessment document, **suggest follow-up commands**:

   ```text
   📋 **Related Commands**:
   - /arckit:analyze - Run comprehensive gap analysis
   - /arckit:hld-review - Review vendor HLD against principles
   - /arckit:dld-review - Review vendor DLD against principles
   - /arckit:service-assessment - GDS Service Standard assessment (UK Gov)
   ```

3. **Track in Project**:
   Suggest adding remediation actions to project tracking:
   - Jira tickets for RED/AMBER gaps
   - Assign owners for each remediation action
   - Set target completion dates aligned with next gate review

## Example Output Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Discovery Phase (Minimal Artifacts)

**Input**: Project in Discovery, only stakeholders and risk register exist

**Expected Output**:

- Most principles: ⚪ NOT ASSESSED (too early)
- A few principles: 🟠 AMBER (if stakeholder/risk docs address them)
- Overall: "Assessment deferred to Alpha gate after requirements created"

### Scenario 2: Alpha Phase (Requirements + HLD)

**Input**: Project in Alpha, requirements and HLD exist

**Expected Output**:

- Strategic principles: 🟢 GREEN (requirements + HLD evidence)
- Security principles: 🟠 AMBER (requirements exist, validation pending)
- Operational principles: ⚪ NOT ASSESSED (too early)
- Overall: "Conditional approval, operational validation at Beta"

### Scenario 3: Beta Phase (Complete Design)

**Input**: Project in Beta, requirements + HLD + DLD exist

**Expected Output**:

- Most principles: 🟢 GREEN (strong evidence)
- Some principles: 🟠 AMBER (testing pending)
- Operational principles: 🟠 AMBER (post-deployment validation needed)
- Overall: "Proceed to Go-Live after AMBER gaps closed"

### Scenario 4: Principle Violation Detected

**Input**: HLD describes manual deployment, violates IaC principle

**Expected Output**:

- IaC principle: 🔴 RED (direct violation)
- Other principles: Mix of GREEN/AMBER
- Overall: "BLOCK - Critical violation of Infrastructure as Code principle"
- Recommendation: "Revise deployment approach OR submit exception request"

## Notes for AI Model

**Critical Implementation Points**:

1. **Dynamic Extraction**: NEVER assume 16 principles exist. Extract however many are in ARC-000-PRIN-*.md.

2. **Evidence Specificity**: ALWAYS link to file:section:line. Bad: "Design addresses this". Good: "HLD Section 4.2 'Security Architecture' (lines 156-203) describes MFA implementation".

3. **Honest Assessment**: Don't inflate scores. If evidence is weak, mark AMBER or RED. False GREEN status harms governance.

4. **Document Length**: Use Write tool. Document will be 500-2000 lines. Do NOT output full document to user - show summary only.

5. **Validation Gates**: If principle defines validation gates, assess each gate individually. This provides granular, actionable feedback.

6. **Context Sensitivity**: NOT ASSESSED is appropriate for Discovery phase. RED is appropriate when principle violated. Choose status based on project context, not to "look good".

7. **Actionable Recommendations**: Every AMBER/RED principle needs specific, actionable remediation steps with owners and dates. Avoid vague advice like "improve security".

8. **Exception Handling**: If RED principle cannot be remediated, guide user through exception request process with CTO/CIO approval.

## Important Notes

- **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

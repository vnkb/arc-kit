You are helping to conduct a **Secure by Design assessment** for a UK Government technology project (civilian/non-MOD).

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Context

UK Government departments must follow NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) guidance and achieve appropriate security certifications before deploying systems. This assessment evaluates security controls using the NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF).

**Key UK Government Security References**:

- NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)
- UK Government Cyber Security Standard (July 2025, Cabinet Office)
- NCSC Vulnerability Monitoring Service (VMS)
- Government Cyber Security Profession & Cyber Academy
- Cyber Essentials / Cyber Essentials Plus
- UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018
- Government Security Classifications Policy
- Cloud Security Principles

## Your Task

> **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

Generate a comprehensive Secure by Design assessment document by:

1. **Loading the template** (with user override support):
   - **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/ukgov-secure-by-design-template.md` exists in the project root
   - **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
   - **If not found**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/ukgov-secure-by-design-template.md` (default)

   > **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize secure`

2. **Understanding the project context**:
   - Department/organization (HMRC, DWP, Home Office, DEFRA, etc.)
   - Data classification (PUBLIC, OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE)
   - Project phase (Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live)
   - User base (public-facing, internal staff, both)
   - Hosting approach (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)

3. **Read existing artifacts from the project context:**

   **MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
   - **REQ** (Requirements) in `projects/{project-name}/`
     - Extract: NFR-SEC (security), NFR-P (performance), NFR-A (availability), INT (integration), DR (data) requirements
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:requirements` first
   - **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in `projects/000-global/`)
     - Extract: Security standards, approved platforms, compliance requirements, cloud policy
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:principles` first

   **RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
   - **RISK** (Risk Register) in `projects/{project-name}/`
     - Extract: Security risks, threat model, risk appetite, mitigations
   - **DPIA** (DPIA) in `projects/{project-name}/`
     - Extract: Personal data processing, lawful basis, data protection risks
   - **DIAG** (Architecture Diagrams) in `projects/{project-name}/diagrams/`
     - Extract: Deployment topology, network boundaries, data flows, integration points

   **OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):
   - **TCOP** (TCoP Assessment) in `projects/{project-name}/`
     - Extract: Technology governance compliance, Point 6 (Secure) findings
   - **AIPB** (AI Playbook) in `projects/{project-name}/`
     - Extract: AI-specific security requirements (prompt injection, data poisoning)
   - **ATRS** (ATRS record) in `projects/{project-name}/`
     - Extract: Algorithmic transparency security requirements

4. **Read external documents and policies**:
   - Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract vulnerability findings, risk ratings, remediation recommendations, threat actors, attack vectors, existing mitigations
   - Read any **global policies** listed in the project context (`000-global/policies/`) — extract security requirements, acceptable risk levels, mandatory controls, certification scope, validity dates
   - Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract enterprise security baselines, penetration test reports, cross-project security assessment patterns
   - If no external docs exist but they would improve the assessment, ask: "Do you have any existing security assessments, pen test reports, or threat models? I can read PDFs and images directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

5. **Assess security using NCSC CAF (14 principles across 4 objectives)**:

   **Objective A: Managing Security Risk (4 principles)**
   - A1: Governance - SIRO appointed, security policies, oversight
   - A2: Risk Management - Asset classification, risk register, treatment plans

   - Gather evidence from project documents
   - Check relevant security controls
   - Identify gaps and risks
   - Provide specific remediation actions with owners and timelines

9. **Calculate overall CAF score**: X/14 principles achieved

10. **Assess UK Government Cyber Security Standard compliance**:

    **9.1 GovAssure Status** — For critical systems subject to GovAssure assurance:
    - Identify which systems are in scope for the current GovAssure cycle
    - Record assessment status per system (Planned / In Progress / Complete)
    - Summarize findings and remediation status
    - Reference NCSC GovAssure guidance

    **9.2 Secure by Design Confidence Rating** — Self-assessment against SbD high-confidence profile:
    - Assess confidence level (Low / Medium / High)
    - Evaluate against SbD principles: secure development, secure deployment, secure operation
    - Document evidence of high-confidence profile achievement
    - Identify gaps and improvement actions

    **9.3 Cyber Security Standard Exception Register** — Per CSS clauses 4.3/4.4:
    - Record any exceptions to CSS compliance with clause references
    - Assess risk for each exception
    - Document mitigation measures and approval authority
    - Track improvement plans to achieve compliance

    **9.4 Cyber Action Plan Alignment** — Assess alignment with the £210m cross-government Cyber Action Plan (February 2026):
    - Determine departmental enrollment and participation status
    - Map project activities to the four Cyber Action Plan pillars: Skills & Workforce, Tooling & Infrastructure, Resilience & Response, Collaboration & Sharing

    - Record Certified Cyber Professional (CCP) certification status for project security roles
    - Map security roles to DDaT (Digital, Data and Technology) profession framework
    - Assess engagement with the Government Cyber Academy (learning areas, completions)
    - Identify workforce development gaps and training actions

11. **Map GovS 007: Security alignment**:
    - Complete the GovS 007 principle mapping table (9 principles → CAF sections and ArcKit artefacts)
    - For principle 5 (Security culture), reference Section 11 (Government Cyber Security Profession) in addition to CAF B6
    - For principle 8 (Continuous improvement), reference Section 9.4 (Cyber Action Plan Alignment) in addition to CAF D2
    - Identify named security role holders (SSRO, DSO, SIRO) and populate the security roles table
    - Assess status for each GovS 007 principle based on evidence from sections 1–9 and the Cyber Action Plan / Profession sections

12. **Identify critical security issues**:

- Issues that block progression to next phase
- Unacceptable risk levels
- Regulatory non-compliance (UK GDPR, Data Protection Act)

13. **Generate actionable recommendations**:
    - Critical priority (0-30 days) - blockers for next phase
    - High priority (1-3 months) - significant risk reduction
    - Medium priority (3-6 months) - continuous improvement
    - Include VMS enrollment and Cyber Action Plan alignment actions where applicable

14. **Detect version**: Before generating the document ID, check if a previous version exists:
    - Look for existing `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-SECD-v*.md` files in the project directory
    - **If no existing file**: Use VERSION="1.0"
    - **If existing file found**:
      - Read the existing document to understand its scope
      - Compare against current inputs and project state
      - **Minor increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1): Scope unchanged — refreshed assessments, updated control status, corrected details
      - **Major increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 2.0): Scope materially changed — new CAF objectives assessed, fundamentally different security posture, significant architecture changes
    - For v1.1+/v2.0+: Add a Revision History entry describing what changed from the previous version

15. **Save the document**: Write to `projects/[project-folder]/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-SECD-v${VERSION}.md`

**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

### Step 1: Construct Document ID

- **Document ID**: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-SECD-v{VERSION}` (e.g., `ARC-001-SECD-v1.0`)

### Step 2: Populate Required Fields

**Auto-populated fields** (populate these automatically):

- `[PROJECT_ID]` → Extract from project path (e.g., "001" from "projects/001-project-name")
- `[VERSION]` → Determined version from step 11
- `[DATE]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME]` → "Secure by Design Assessment"
- `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-SECD-v[VERSION]` → Construct using format from Step 1
- `[COMMAND]` → "arckit.secure"

**User-provided fields** (extract from project metadata or user input):

- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Full project name from project metadata or user input
- `[OWNER_NAME_AND_ROLE]` → Document owner (prompt user if not in metadata)
- `[CLASSIFICATION]` → Default to "OFFICIAL" for UK Gov, "PUBLIC" otherwise (or prompt user)

**Calculated fields**:

- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Current date + 30 days (requirements, research, risks)
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Phase gate dates (Alpha/Beta/Live for compliance docs)

**Pending fields** (leave as [PENDING] until manually updated):

- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to "Project Team, Architecture Team" or [PENDING]

### Step 3: Populate Revision History

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit:secure` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

### Step 4: Populate Generation Metadata Footer

The footer should be populated with:

```markdown
**Generated by**: ArcKit `/arckit:secure` command
**Generated on**: {DATE} {TIME} GMT
**ArcKit Version**: {ARCKIT_VERSION}
**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME} (Project {PROJECT_ID})
**AI Model**: [Use actual model name, e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"]

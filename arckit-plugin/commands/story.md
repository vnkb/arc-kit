allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep
argument-hint: "<project ID, e.g. '001'>"
---

You are helping an enterprise architect **generate a comprehensive project story** that documents the journey of an ArcKit-managed project from inception to completion, with heavy emphasis on timeline analysis and governance achievements.

This command creates a **ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-STRY-v1.0.md** document that serves as:

- A historical record of the project's evolution through the ArcKit governance framework
- A detailed timeline analysis with multiple visualization types (Gantt, flowchart, table, pie chart)
- A demonstration of end-to-end traceability from stakeholder needs to delivery plans
- A showcase of governance quality and compliance achievements

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Instructions

> **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

### Step 0: Read existing artifacts from the project context

**MANDATORY** (warn if missing):

- **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in `projects/000-global/`)
  - Extract: Governance standards, technology constraints, compliance framework
  - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:principles` first — principles are the foundation of the ArcKit governance framework

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):

- **STKE** (Stakeholder Analysis) — personas, goals, priorities
- **RISK** (Risk Register) — risks, mitigations, risk appetite
- **SOBC** (Business Case) — benefits, costs, ROI
- **REQ** (Requirements) — BR/FR/NFR/INT/DR traceability
- **DATA** (Data Model) — entities, relationships, governance
- **DIAG** (Architecture Diagrams) — C4, deployment, data flow
- **RSCH** / **AWSR** / **AZUR** — technology research
- **WARD** (Wardley Map) — strategic positioning
- **PLAN** (Project Plan) — timeline, phases, gates
- **SOW** / **DOS** — procurement documents
- **EVAL** (Evaluation Criteria) — vendor evaluation
- **HLDR** / **DLDR** (Design Reviews)
- **TCOP** (TCoP Assessment)
- **SECD** / **MSBD** — security assessments
- **DPIA** (DPIA)
- **AIPB** (AI Playbook)
- **ATRS** (ATRS record)
- **BKLG** (Product Backlog)
- **DEVOPS** (DevOps Strategy)
- **TRAC** (Traceability Matrix)
- **ROAD** (Roadmap)
- **ANLZ** (Governance Analysis)

**Minimum artifact check**: A meaningful project story requires at least 3-5 artifacts. If the project has fewer than 3, warn:

```text
⚠️  Warning: This project only has [N] artifacts.

A comprehensive story typically requires at least:
- Architecture principles (global)
- Stakeholder analysis
- Requirements or Risk Register

Consider running more ArcKit commands before generating the story, or proceed
with a limited story based on available artifacts.
```

### Step 0b: Read external documents and policies

- Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract project history, key milestones, lessons learned, user research insights, governance decisions
- Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract enterprise reporting templates, programme dashboards, cross-project narrative standards
- If no external docs exist but they would enrich the project story, ask: "Do you have any project reports, user research findings, or governance decision records? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

### Step 1: Identify the target project

- Use the **ArcKit Project Context** (above) to find the project matching the user's input (by name or number)
- If no match, create a new project:
  1. Use Glob to list `projects/*/` directories and find the highest `NNN-*` number (or start at `001` if none exist)
  2. Calculate the next number (zero-padded to 3 digits, e.g., `002`)
  3. Slugify the project name (lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with hyphens, trim)
  4. Use the Write tool to create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/README.md` with the project name, ID, and date — the Write tool will create all parent directories automatically
  5. Also create `projects/{NNN}-{slug}/external/README.md` with a note to place external reference documents here
  6. Set `PROJECT_ID` = the 3-digit number, `PROJECT_PATH` = the new directory path

### Step 2: Comprehensive Project Artifact Scan

Scan the project directory to find ALL artifacts:

```bash
# Find all .md files in the project directory
find "$PROJECT_DIR" -type f -name "*.md" | sort
```

**Expected Artifacts** (categorize by type):

**Foundation Artifacts**:

- `ARC-*-STKE-*.md` - Stakeholder analysis
- `ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` in `projects/000-global/` - Architecture principles (global)
- `ARC-*-RISK-*.md` - Risk assessment

**Business Case Artifacts**:

- `ARC-*-SOBC-*.md` - Strategic Outline Business Case

- `wardley-maps/ARC-*-WARD-*.md` - Wardley maps
- `diagrams/ARC-*-DIAG-*.md` - C4 and deployment diagrams
- `ARC-*-PLAN-*.md` - Project plan with timeline

**Procurement Artifacts**:

- `ARC-*-SOW-*.md` - Statement of Work
- `ARC-*-DOS-*.md` - Digital Outcomes and Specialists
- `ARC-*-EVAL-*.md` - Vendor evaluation framework
- `vendors/*/scoring.md` - Vendor scoring sheets

**Design Review Artifacts**:

- `vendors/*/reviews/ARC-*-HLDR-*.md` - High-Level Design reviews
- `vendors/*/reviews/ARC-*-DLDR-*.md` - Detailed Design reviews

**Delivery Artifacts**:

- `ARC-*-BKLG-*.md` - Product backlog with user stories
- `ARC-*-SNOW-*.md` - ServiceNow CMDB and SLA design

**Compliance Artifacts**:

- `ARC-*-TCOP-*.md` - Technology Code of Practice

**Governance Artifacts**:

- `ARC-*-TRAC-*.md` - End-to-end traceability
- `ARC-*-ANAL-*.md` - Governance quality analysis

For each artifact found, note:

- File path
- File name (maps to ArcKit command used)
- Date created (from file modification time or git log)
- Size (as proxy for completeness)

### Step 3: Extract Comprehensive Timeline

**Preferred Method: Git Log Analysis**

If the project is under git version control, extract the timeline from git history:

```bash
cd "$PROJECT_DIR"

# Get detailed git log with timestamps for all project files
git log --follow --format="%ai | %s" --name-only -- . | grep -E "(\.md|^[0-9]{4})"
```

This will show:

- Timestamps (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- Commit messages (which often contain ArcKit command names like "/arckit:requirements")
- Files changed

**Parse this data to create timeline events**:

- Event date/time
- Command used (extract from commit message)
- Artifact created/modified
- Days from project start

**Fallback Method: File Modification Dates**

If git log is not available or sparse, use file modification times:

```bash
# Get file modification times
stat -c "%y %n" "$PROJECT_DIR"/*.md | sort
stat -c "%y %n" "$PROJECT_DIR"/vendors/*/*.md | sort
stat -c "%y %n" "$PROJECT_DIR"/diagrams/ARC-*-DIAG-*.md | sort
stat -c "%y %n" "$PROJECT_DIR"/wardley-maps/ARC-*-WARD-*.md | sort
```

**Extract Timeline Metrics**:

- **Project start date**: Earliest file/commit date
- **Project end date**: Latest file/commit date (or "Ongoing")
- **Total duration**: Days between start and end
- **Total artifacts**: Count of all .md files found
- **Commands executed**: Count of unique artifacts (proxy for commands)
- **Phase durations**: Calculate time spent in each phase based on artifact types
- **Velocity**: Artifacts per week, commands per week
- **Longest phase**: Which phase took most time and why
- **Shortest phase**: Which phase was fastest and why

**Timeline Data Structure**:

Create an internal data structure like:

```text
Timeline Events:
[
  {
    date: "2024-01-15",
    days_from_start: 0,
    event_type: "Foundation",
    command: "/arckit:principles",
    artifact: "ARC-000-PRIN-v1.0.md",
    description: "Established enterprise architecture principles"
  },
  {
    date: "2024-01-18",
    days_from_start: 3,
    event_type: "Foundation",
    command: "/arckit:stakeholders",
    artifact: "ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-STKE-v1.0.md",
    description: "Analyzed 8 stakeholders, 12 goals, 15 outcomes"
  },
  ...

- User Stories → Sprint Backlog

**Chain 5: Data Flow**

- Data Model Entities → Data Requirements (DR-xxx)
- Data Requirements → CMDB Configuration Items

**Chain 6: Compliance Flow**

- Requirements → Compliance Assessments
- Architecture Principles → Design Reviews
- Risk Register → Security Assessments

### Step 5b: Load Mermaid Syntax References

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/mermaid-syntax/references/gantt.md`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/mermaid-syntax/references/flowchart.md`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/mermaid-syntax/references/pie.md`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/mermaid-syntax/references/timeline.md`, and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/mermaid-syntax/references/mindmap.md` for official Mermaid syntax — date formats, task statuses, node shapes, edge labels, pie chart syntax, timeline formatting, mindmap indentation, and styling options.

### Step 6: Generate Timeline Visualizations

Create **4 types of timeline visualizations** using the timeline data extracted:

**Visualization 1: Gantt Chart**

Use Mermaid gantt syntax to create a visual timeline by phase:

```mermaid
gantt
    title [PROJECT_NAME] Project Timeline
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD

    section Foundation
    Architecture Principles         :done, principles, [START_DATE], [DURATION]
    Stakeholder Analysis           :done, stakeholders, after principles, [DURATION]
    Risk Assessment                :done, risk, after stakeholders, [DURATION]

    section Business Case
    Strategic Outline Business Case :done, sobc, [DATE], [DURATION]
    Data Model                     :done, data, after sobc, [DURATION]

    section Requirements
    Requirements Definition        :done, req, [DATE], [DURATION]
    Wardley Mapping               :done, wardley, after req, [DURATION]
    Technology Research           :done, research, after req, [DURATION]

    section Procurement
    Statement of Work             :done, sow, [DATE], [DURATION]
    Vendor Evaluation            :done, eval, after sow, [DURATION]

    section Design
    Architecture Diagrams        :done, diagrams, [DATE], [DURATION]
    High-Level Design Review     :done, hld, after diagrams, [DURATION]
    Detailed Design Review       :done, dld, after hld, [DURATION]

    section Delivery
    Product Backlog             :done, backlog, [DATE], [DURATION]
    ServiceNow Design           :done, snow, after backlog, [DURATION]

    section Compliance
    Service Assessment          :done, assessment, [DATE], [DURATION]
    Secure by Design           :done, secure, after assessment, [DURATION]

    section Governance
    Traceability Matrix        :done, trace, [DATE], [DURATION]
    Quality Analysis           :done, analyze, after trace, [DURATION]
```

**Important**: Use actual dates from timeline data. Calculate durations between events. Only include phases/commands that actually exist in the project.

**Visualization 2: Linear Command Flow Timeline**

Use Mermaid flowchart with dates on each command node:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Project Initiated<br/>[START_DATE]]) --> Principles

    Principles["arckit.principles<br/>[DATE]<br/>Architecture Principles"] --> Stakeholders
    Stakeholders["arckit.stakeholders<br/>[DATE]<br/>Stakeholder Analysis"] --> Risk
    Risk["arckit.risk<br/>[DATE]<br/>Risk Register"] --> SOBC

    [... continue for all commands actually executed ...]

    Trace["arckit.traceability<br/>[DATE]<br/>Traceability Matrix"] --> Analyze
    Analyze["arckit.analyze<br/>[DATE]<br/>Quality Analysis"] --> End

    End([Project Complete<br/>[END_DATE]])

    style Start fill:#e1f5e1
    style End fill:#e1f5e1
```

**Visualization 3: Timeline Table**

Create a detailed table with all events:

| # | Date | Days from Start | Event Type | Command | Artifact | Description |
|---|------|-----------------|------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | [DATE] | 0 | Foundation | `/arckit:principles` | ARC-000-PRIN-v1.0.md | Established enterprise architecture principles |
| 2 | [DATE] | [DAYS] | Foundation | `/arckit:stakeholders` | ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-STKE-v1.0.md | Analyzed [N] stakeholders, [M] goals, [P] outcomes |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Visualization 4: Phase Duration Pie Chart**

Calculate percentage of time spent in each phase:

```mermaid
pie title Project Phase Time Distribution
    "Foundation (Principles, Stakeholders, Risk)" : [PERCENTAGE]
    "Business Case & Requirements" : [PERCENTAGE]
    "Research & Strategic Planning" : [PERCENTAGE]
    "Procurement & Vendor Selection" : [PERCENTAGE]
    "Design & Review" : [PERCENTAGE]
    "Delivery Planning" : [PERCENTAGE]
    "Compliance & Security" : [PERCENTAGE]
    "Governance & Traceability" : [PERCENTAGE]
```

### Step 7: Generate Additional Mermaid Diagrams

**Timeline Milestone Chart**:

```mermaid
timeline
    title [PROJECT_NAME] Key Milestones
    [START_DATE] : Project Initiated
                  : Architecture Principles Established
    [DATE] : Stakeholder Analysis Complete
           : [N] Stakeholders, [M] Goals
    [DATE] : Business Case Approved
           : SOBC (5-case model)
    [... key milestones with dates ...]
    [END_DATE] : Project Governance Complete
              : Traceability Matrix Verified
```

**Traceability Chain Flowchart**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Foundation
        Principles[Architecture<br/>Principles<br/>[N] principles]
        Stakeholders[Stakeholder<br/>Analysis<br/>[M] stakeholders]
        Risk[Risk<br/>Register<br/>[Q] risks]
    end

    subgraph Requirements
        BR[Business<br/>Requirements<br/>[BR_COUNT] BR]
        FR[Functional<br/>Requirements<br/>[FR_COUNT] FR]
        NFR[Non-Functional<br/>Requirements<br/>[NFR_COUNT] NFR]
    end

    [... show full traceability flow ...]

    style Principles fill:#fff4e6
    style Requirements fill:#e1f5e1
```

**Governance Achievements Mind Map**:

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Project<br/>Achievements))
    Foundation
      Architecture Principles Established
      [N] Stakeholders Engaged
      [M] Risks Managed
    Business Case
      SOBC Approved
      [NPV] NPV
      Data Model GDPR Compliant
    [... continue for all phases ...]
```

### Step 8: Write Design & Delivery Review Chapters

For **the 2 key chapters** in the template, write a comprehensive narrative using the data extracted:

**Chapter 6: Design Review - Validating the Solution**

- Timeline context: Dates, duration, percentage of project timeline
- What happened: Vendor designs underwent rigorous ArcKit governance reviews
- Key activities:
  - High-Level Design Review (HLD): Assessment against principles, requirements, NFRs, risks
  - Detailed Design Review (DLD): API specs, database schemas, security controls, performance
- Findings: Strengths, concerns, gaps for both HLD and DLD
- Verdict: APPROVED/APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS/REJECTED for each review
- Decision Points: HLD review decision, DLD review decision
- Traceability Chain: Principles → HLD, Requirements → HLD/DLD, Risk → DLD
- Artifacts created: ARC-*-HLDR-*.md, ARC-*-DLDR-*.md

**Chapter 7: Delivery Planning - From Requirements to Sprints**

- Timeline context: Dates, duration, percentage of project
- What happened: Translating approved designs into delivery plans
- Key activities:
  - Product Backlog: Requirements → GDS user stories, MoSCoW prioritization, sprint planning
  - ServiceNow Design: CMDB CIs, SLA definitions, incident/change management workflows
- Backlog Summary: Story count, sprint count, velocity assumptions
- Traceability Chain: Requirements → User Stories → Sprint Backlog, Components → CMDB CIs
- Artifacts created: ARC-*-BKLG-*.md, ARC-*-SNOW-*.md

### Step 9: Calculate Timeline Metrics

Create a comprehensive metrics table:

| Metric | Value | Analysis |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Project Duration** | [TOTAL_DAYS] days ([TOTAL_WEEKS] weeks) | [Analysis: faster/slower than typical] |
| **Average Phase Duration** | [AVG_DAYS] days | [Comparison] |
| **Longest Phase** | [PHASE_NAME] ([DAYS] days) | [Why this took longest] |
| **Shortest Phase** | [PHASE_NAME] ([DAYS] days) | [Why this was fastest] |
| **Commands per Week** | [VELOCITY] | [Velocity analysis] |
| **Artifacts per Week** | [VELOCITY] | [Output rate] |
| **Time to First Artifact** | [DAYS] days | From start to ARC-000-PRIN-v1.0.md |
| **Time to Requirements** | [DAYS] days | Critical milestone |
| **Time to Vendor Selection** | [DAYS] days | Critical milestone |
| **Time to Design Review** | [DAYS] days | Critical milestone |
| **Compliance Time** | [DAYS] days ([PERCENTAGE]% of total) | Time on compliance |

### Step 10: Write Timeline Insights & Analysis

Write comprehensive analysis sections:

**Pacing Analysis**:

- Overall pacing assessment: Steady/Accelerated/Extended
- Phase-by-phase analysis
- Comparison to typical ArcKit projects

**Critical Path**:

- Identify the critical path through the project
- Show longest dependency chains
- Identify parallel workstreams that could have been done concurrently

**Timeline Deviations**:

- Expected vs actual durations (if project plan exists)
- Reasons for deviations
- Impact assessment

**Velocity Metrics**:

- Commands per week over time
- Peak velocity periods
- Slowest periods and reasons

**Lessons Learned**:

- What went well (timeline perspective)
- What could be improved
- Recommendations for future projects

### Step 11: Detect Version

Before generating the document ID, check if a previous version exists:

1. Look for existing `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-STRY-v*.md` files in the project directory
2. **If no existing file**: Use VERSION="1.0"
3. **If existing file found**:
   - Read the existing document to understand its scope
   - Compare against current project artifacts and timeline
   - **Minor increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1): Scope unchanged — refreshed metrics, updated timeline, corrected details
   - **Major increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 2.0): Scope materially changed — new project phases covered, fundamentally different achievements, significant new artifacts added
4. Use the determined version for document ID, filename, Document Control, and Revision History
5. For v1.1+/v2.0+: Add a Revision History entry describing what changed from the previous version

### Step 12: Construct Document Control Metadata

Construct document control fields:

- **Document ID**: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-STRY-v{VERSION}` (e.g., `ARC-001-STRY-v1.0`)
- **Date Created**: Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format

Document control fields:

- `{document_id}`: Generated doc ID (e.g., ARC-001-STORY-v1.0)
- `{version}`: v${VERSION}
- `{status}`: Final
- `{date_created}`: Today's date
- `{last_updated}`: Today's date
- `{project_id}`: From project directory name (e.g., 001)

### Step 13: Read Template and Populate

Read the story template:

**Read the template** (with user override support):

- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/story-template.md` exists in the project root
- **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
- **If not found**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/story-template.md` (default)

> **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize story`

**Populate ALL placeholders** in the template with real data:

**Square bracket placeholders** (manual placeholders in template):

- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Actual project name
- `[START_DATE]` → Earliest date from timeline
- `[END_DATE]` → Latest date from timeline
- `[TOTAL_DAYS]` → Calculated duration
- `[TOTAL_WEEKS]` → Calculated duration in weeks
- `[ARTIFACT_COUNT]` → Count of artifacts found
- `[COMMAND_COUNT]` → Count of commands executed
- `[N]`, `[M]`, `[P]`, `[Q]` → Actual counts from artifact analysis
- `[BR_COUNT]`, `[FR_COUNT]`, `[NFR_COUNT]`, etc. → Actual requirement counts
- `[DATE]` → Actual dates from timeline
- `[DAYS]` → Actual day counts
- `[PERCENTAGE]` → Actual calculated percentages
- `[VENDOR_NAME]` → Actual vendor name if selected
- `[BUILD/BUY]` → Actual decision
- All other placeholders → Replace with actual data

**Curly brace placeholders** (document control):

- `{document_id}` → Generated document ID
- `{version}` → v1.0
- `{status}` → Final
- `{date_created}` → Today's date
- `{last_updated}` → Today's date
- `{project_id}` → Project ID

**CRITICAL**:

- Replace **EVERY** placeholder with real data
- If data is not available, use "Not available" or "N/A"
- Ensure all Mermaid diagrams have real dates and data
- Ensure all tables are complete with real counts
- Write full narrative paragraphs for each chapter with real project details

### Step 14: Write ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-STRY-v${VERSION}.md Using Write Tool

**CRITICAL**: Use the **Write tool** to create the document. Do NOT output the full content in your response.

```text
Write tool:
- file_path: projects/[PROJECT_ID]-[PROJECT_NAME]/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-STRY-v1.0.md
- content: [Full populated template with all placeholders replaced]
```

The document will be **2000-3000 lines** with:

- Complete document control
- Executive summary with metrics
- 4 timeline visualizations
- Timeline metrics table
- Milestone timeline
- 2 detailed narrative chapters (Design Review & Delivery Planning)
- Timeline insights & analysis
- Complete traceability chain with Mermaid diagrams
- Key outcomes & achievements
- 5 comprehensive appendices

### Step 15: Show Concise Summary to User

After writing the file, show the user a **concise summary** (NOT the full document):

```text
✅ Project story generated: projects/001-cabinet-office-genai/ARC-001-STRY-v1.0.md

📊 **Project Timeline Summary**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Project**: Cabinet Office GenAI Chatbot Platform

**Adapt the summary** based on actual project data. Show real numbers, real dates, real achievements.

## Important Notes

1. **Prerequisites first**: Always check that architecture principles exist before generating a story. The principles command (`/arckit:principles`) is the foundation of the ArcKit governance framework and should be the FIRST command run in any project.

2. **Use Write tool**: The ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-STRY-v1.0.md will be 2000-3000 lines. You MUST use the Write tool to avoid exceeding token limits.

3. **Real data only**: Replace ALL placeholders with real data extracted from artifacts. No "[PLACEHOLDER]" should remain in the final document.

4. **Timeline emphasis**: The story is primarily about the timeline. Every chapter should have timeline context (dates, durations, pacing analysis).

5. **Git log preferred**: If available, use git log for most accurate timeline. Fall back to file modification dates if needed.

6. **Comprehensive analysis**: Don't just list what happened - analyze why, how it compares to typical projects, what lessons can be learned.

7. **Mermaid diagrams**: Generate at least 7-10 Mermaid diagrams (Gantt, flowchart, table, pie, timeline, traceability, mind map, DSM).

8. **Traceability**: Show complete end-to-end traceability chains with actual counts.

9. **Metrics**: Calculate real metrics (velocity, phase durations, percentages).

10. **Narrative**: Write engaging narrative chapters that tell the story of how the project evolved, not just a dry list of facts.

11. **Quality**: This is a showcase document. Make it comprehensive, accurate, and professionally written.

- **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

## Example Usage

```bash
# Generate story for a specific project
/arckit:story Cabinet Office GenAI

# Generate story for project by number
/arckit:story 009

# Let user choose from list
/arckit:story

# Generate story for current directory
cd projects/009-cabinet-office-genai
/arckit:story .
```

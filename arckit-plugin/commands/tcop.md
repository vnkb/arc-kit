# Technology Code of Practice Review

You are helping to conduct a **Technology Code of Practice (TCoP) review** for a UK Government technology project or programme.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Context

The Technology Code of Practice is a set of 13 criteria to help government design, build and buy technology. It's used by the Digital Spend Control team to assess technology spending proposals.

**TCoP Reference**: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice

## Your Task

Generate a comprehensive TCoP review document by:

1. **Loading the template** (with user override support):
   - **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/tcop-review-template.md` exists in the project root
   - **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
   - **If not found**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/tcop-review-template.md` (default)

   > **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize tcop`

2. **Read Available Documents**:

   > **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

   **MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
   - **REQ** (Requirements) — Extract: FR/NFR IDs, technology constraints, compliance requirements
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:requirements` first
   - **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in 000-global) — Extract: Technology standards, approved platforms, security requirements
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:principles` first

   **RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
   - **STKE** (Stakeholder Analysis) — Extract: User needs, priorities
   - **RISK** (Risk Register) — Extract: Security and compliance risks
   - **DIAG** (Architecture Diagrams, in diagrams/) — Extract: Deployment topology

   **OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):
   - **RSCH** / **AWRS** / **AZRS** (Research) — Extract: Technology choices
   - **AIPB** (AI Playbook) — Extract: AI/ML system assessments
   - **DPIA** (Data Protection Impact Assessment) — Extract: Data protection context

3. **Assess compliance**: Based on the user's description and any existing project documentation, assess compliance against all 13 TCoP points:
   - Point 1: Define user needs
   - Point 2: Make things accessible and inclusive
   - Point 3: Be open and use open source
   - Point 4: Make use of open standards
   - Point 5: Use cloud first
   - Point 6: Make things secure
   - Point 7: Make privacy integral
   - Point 8: Share, reuse and collaborate
   - Point 9: Integrate and adapt technology
   - Point 10: Make better use of data
   - Point 11: Define your purchasing strategy
   - Point 12: Make your technology sustainable
   - Point 13: Meet the Service Standard

4. **Read external documents and policies**:
   - Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract previous TCoP assessment results, departmental interpretations of TCoP points, remediation plans
   - Read any **global policies** listed in the project context (`000-global/policies/`) — extract approved technology lists, procurement policies, cloud-first mandates
   - Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract enterprise technology standards, digital strategy documents, cross-project TCoP compliance evidence
   - If no external docs found but they would improve the TCoP assessment, ask: "Do you have any previous TCoP assessments or departmental technology policy documents? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

5. **For each TCoP point**:
   - Assess status: ✅ Compliant / ⚠️ Partially Compliant / ❌ Non-Compliant / N/A Not Applicable
   - Provide evidence of how the project meets (or fails to meet) the criteria
   - Check relevant checklist items based on project information
   - Identify gaps and required actions

6. **Provide realistic assessments**:
   - Be honest about compliance gaps
   - Mark items as "Partially Compliant" if only some aspects are met
   - Use "N/A" only when truly not applicable
   - Provide actionable recommendations for gaps

7. **Generate compliance scorecard**: Create a summary showing status of all 13 points

8. **Prioritize actions**: Identify critical issues requiring immediate attention

9. **Detect version**: Before generating the document ID, check if a previous version exists:
   - Look for existing `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-TCOP-v*.md` files in the project directory
   - **If no existing file**: Use VERSION="1.0"
   - **If existing file found**:
     - Read the existing document to understand its scope
     - Compare against current project state and compliance evidence
     - **Minor increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1): Scope unchanged — refreshed assessments, updated evidence, corrected details
     - **Major increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 2.0): Scope materially changed — new TCoP points assessed, fundamentally different compliance posture, significant project changes
   - For v1.1+/v2.0+: Add a Revision History entry describing what changed from the previous version

10. **Save the document**: Write to `projects/[project-folder]/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-TCOP-v${VERSION}.md`

**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

### Step 1: Construct Document ID

- **Document ID**: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-TCOP-v{VERSION}` (e.g., `ARC-001-TCOP-v1.0`)

### Step 2: Populate Required Fields

**Auto-populated fields** (populate these automatically):

- `[PROJECT_ID]` → Extract from project path (e.g., "001" from "projects/001-project-name")
- `[VERSION]` → Determined version from step 8
- `[DATE]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME]` → "Technology Code of Practice Review"
- `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-TCOP-v[VERSION]` → Construct using format from Step 1
- `[COMMAND]` → "arckit.tcop"

**User-provided fields** (extract from project metadata or user input):

- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Full project name from project metadata or user input
- `[OWNER_NAME_AND_ROLE]` → Document owner (prompt user if not in metadata)
- `[CLASSIFICATION]` → Default to "OFFICIAL" for UK Gov, "PUBLIC" otherwise (or prompt user)

**Calculated fields**:

- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Current date + 30 days (requirements, research, risks)
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Phase gate dates (Alpha/Beta/Live for compliance docs)

**Pending fields** (leave as [PENDING] until manually updated):

- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to "Project Team, Architecture Team" or [PENDING]

### Step 3: Populate Revision History

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit:tcop` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

### Step 4: Populate Generation Metadata Footer

The footer should be populated with:

```markdown
**Generated by**: ArcKit `/arckit:tcop` command
**Generated on**: {DATE} {TIME} GMT
**ArcKit Version**: {ARCKIT_VERSION}
**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME} (Project {PROJECT_ID})
**AI Model**: [Use actual model name, e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"]
**Generation Context**: [Brief note about source documents used]
```

### Example Fully Populated Document Control Section

```markdown
## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Document ID** | ARC-001-TCOP-v1.0 |
| **Document Type** | {Document purpose} |
| **Project** | Windows 10 to Windows 11 Migration (Project 001) |
| **Classification** | OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE |
| **Status** | DRAFT |
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Created Date** | 2025-10-29 |
| **Last Modified** | 2025-10-29 |
| **Review Date** | 2025-11-30 |
| **Owner** | John Smith (Business Analyst) |
| **Reviewed By** | [PENDING] |
| **Approved By** | [PENDING] |
| **Distribution** | PM Team, Architecture Team, Dev Team |

## Revision History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes | Approved By | Approval Date |
|---------|------|--------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 1.0 | 2025-10-29 | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit:tcop` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

## Output Format

The document must include:

- Executive summary with overall compliance status
- Detailed assessment for each of the 13 TCoP points
- Evidence and checklist items for each point
- Gaps and required actions
- Overall compliance scorecard (X/13 compliant)
- Critical issues list
- Prioritized recommendations (High/Medium/Low)
- Next steps with timeline
- GovS 005 alignment mapping (TCoP-to-GovS 005 principle traceability and governance obligations)
- Approval section

## Assessment Guidelines

**When assessing compliance**:

- **✅ Compliant**: Clear evidence exists, all key criteria met, no significant gaps
- **⚠️ Partially Compliant**: Some aspects addressed but significant gaps remain, or evidence is incomplete
- **❌ Non-Compliant**: Criteria not met, no evidence of compliance, or critical gaps exist
- **N/A**: Point is genuinely not applicable (e.g., Point 13 if not building a public service)

**Common critical issues**:

- No DPIA for projects processing personal data (Point 7)
- No accessibility testing for user-facing services (Point 2)
- No security assessment completed (Point 6)
- Public cloud not considered (Point 5)
- No user research conducted (Point 1)

**Project phases matter**:

- **Discovery/Alpha**: User research, technical spikes, open source exploration expected
- **Beta**: Accessibility testing, security assessments, DPIA should be complete
- **Live**: All 13 points must be fully compliant

## Special Considerations

**For AI/ML systems**: Also consider requirements from the AI Playbook (may need ATRS - Algorithmic Transparency Record)

**For public-facing services**: Point 13 (Service Standard) is mandatory - must pass GDS service assessments

**For Digital Spend Control submissions**: Focus on points most relevant to spending approval:

- Point 5 (Cloud First)
- Point 11 (Purchasing Strategy)
- Point 8 (Reuse and Collaboration)

**Data protection**: If processing personal data, Point 7 is critical - DPIA completion is mandatory before going live

## UK Government Context

Be aware of:

- **Digital Marketplace**: G-Cloud, DOS frameworks for procurement
- **GDS Service Standard**: 14-point standard for public services
- **NCSC guidance**: Cyber security best practices
- **UK GDPR**: Data protection requirements
- **Cyber Essentials**: Baseline security certification
- **Cloud First policy**: Public cloud preferred unless justified otherwise
- **GovS 005**: TCoP is the implementation guidance for the Government Functional Standard for Digital — include GovS 005 alignment mapping

## Example Output Structure

```markdown
# Technology Code of Practice (TCoP) Review

**Project**: Benefits Eligibility Chatbot
**Overall TCoP Compliance**: Partially Compliant

## TCoP Point 1: Define User Needs
**Status**: ✅ Compliant
**Evidence**: User research completed with 50+ DWP claimants...
[Checked items and gaps listed]

## TCoP Point 6: Make Things Secure
**Status**: ⚠️ Partially Compliant
**Evidence**: Threat model exists, but penetration testing not yet completed...
**Gaps/Actions Required**:
- Schedule pen test before Private Beta (HIGH PRIORITY)
...

## Overall Compliance Summary
**Score**: 9/13 Compliant (3 Partially Compliant, 1 N/A)
**Critical Issues**:
1. DPIA not completed (Point 7) - BLOCKING for Beta
2. Accessibility audit incomplete (Point 2) - Required for Beta
```

## Notes

- Be thorough but practical - this is a governance document, not just a checkbox exercise
- Highlight blockers that prevent progression to next phase
- Reference official GOV.UK guidance URLs for each point
- Consider the project's maturity - don't expect Live compliance in Discovery
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations rather than generic advice

Generate the TCoP review now based on the project information provided.

## Important Notes

- **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

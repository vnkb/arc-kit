## Instructions

> **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

1. **Identify the project**: The user should specify a project name or number
   - Example: "Generate traceability matrix for payment gateway project"
   - Example: "Update traceability for project 001"

2. **Read all project artifacts**:
   - **REQ** (Requirements) — Source of truth for all requirements
   - **HLDR** (HLD Reviews, in vendors/{vendor}/reviews/) — Review findings
   - **DLDR** (DLD Reviews, in vendors/{vendor}/reviews/) — Review findings
   - Also read vendor HLD/DLD submissions in `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/`

   **Read the template** (with user override support):
   - **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/traceability-matrix-template.md` exists in the project root
   - **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
   - **If not found**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/traceability-matrix-template.md` (default)

   > **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize traceability`

3. **Read external documents and policies**:
   - Read any **vendor designs** in `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/` — extract component-to-requirement mappings, API-to-feature mappings, test coverage evidence
   - Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract test results, code coverage reports, deployment records
   - Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract enterprise traceability standards, test strategy documents, cross-project requirements management frameworks
   - If no external docs found but they would improve traceability coverage, ask: "Do you have any vendor design documents, test plans, or implementation records? I can read PDFs and images directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip."

4. **Build the traceability matrix**:

   ### Forward Traceability (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Tests)

   For each requirement (BR, FR, NFR, INT, DR):

   **Step 1: Requirement Details**
   - Requirement ID (e.g., FR-001)
   - Requirement statement
   - Priority (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
   - Category (Business/Functional/Non-Functional/Integration/Data)

   **Step 2: Design Mapping**
   - Which HLD components implement this requirement?
   - Which DLD modules/classes handle this?
   - Architecture patterns used
   - Design decisions made

   **Step 3: Implementation Mapping**
   - Source code files/modules (if available)
   - APIs/endpoints that satisfy this
   - Database tables/schemas involved
   - Configuration requirements

   **Step 4: Test Coverage**
   - Unit test references
   - Integration test scenarios
   - Performance test cases (for NFRs)
   - Security test cases (for security requirements)
   - UAT test cases

   **Step 5: Status**
   - ✅ Fully implemented and tested
   - 🔄 In progress
   - ⏳ Planned
   - ❌ Not covered (GAP!)

   ### Backward Traceability (Tests → Implementation → Design → Requirements)

   For each test case:
   - Which requirements does it verify?
   - Which design components does it test?
   - What's the expected outcome?

   ### Gap Analysis

   Identify and flag:
   - **Orphan Requirements**: Requirements with NO design/implementation
   - **Orphan Design Elements**: Design components not linked to requirements (scope creep?)
   - **Orphan Tests**: Tests not linked to requirements (what are they testing?)
   - **Coverage Gaps**: Requirements without adequate test coverage

5. **Analyze coverage metrics**:

   Calculate and report:
   - **Requirements Coverage**: % of requirements with design mapping
   - **Implementation Coverage**: % of requirements implemented
   - **Test Coverage**: % of requirements with tests
   - **By Priority**:
     - MUST requirements: Should be 100% covered
     - SHOULD requirements: Should be >80% covered
     - MAY requirements: Can be <50% covered

   Example:

   ```text
   Overall Coverage:
   - Business Requirements: 15/15 (100%)
   - Functional Requirements: 42/45 (93%) - 3 gaps
   - Non-Functional Requirements: 18/22 (82%) - 4 gaps
   - Integration Requirements: 8/8 (100%)

   Priority Coverage:
   - MUST requirements: 68/70 (97%) - 2 CRITICAL GAPS
   - SHOULD requirements: 12/15 (80%)
   - MAY requirements: 3/8 (38%)
   ```

6. **Risk Assessment**:

   Flag high-risk gaps:
   - **CRITICAL**: MUST requirements not covered
   - **HIGH**: Security/compliance requirements without tests
   - **MEDIUM**: Performance requirements without validation
   - **LOW**: Optional features not implemented

7. **Generate Traceability Report**:

   Create comprehensive report with:

   **Executive Summary**:
   - Overall traceability score (0-100)
   - Coverage by requirement type
   - Critical gaps requiring attention
   - Recommendation (Ready for Release / Gaps Must Be Addressed)

   **Detailed Traceability Matrix**:
   Large table with columns:
   | Req ID | Requirement | Priority | HLD Component | DLD Module | Implementation | Tests | Status |

   **Gap Analysis**:
   - List of orphan requirements (requirements not in design)
   - List of orphan design elements (design not in requirements - scope creep!)
   - List of untested requirements
   - Recommendations for each gap

   **Coverage Metrics**:
   - Visual representation (can use markdown tables/charts)
   - Breakdown by requirement type
   - Breakdown by priority
   - Trend over time (if multiple traceability runs)

   **Action Items**:
   - BLOCKING gaps (must fix before release)
   - Non-blocking gaps (fix in next sprint)
   - Technical debt to track

8. **Write outputs**:
   - `projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-TRAC-v${VERSION}.md` - Full traceability matrix
   - `projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-COVR-v${VERSION}.md` - Coverage metrics and gaps
   - `projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-GAPS-v${VERSION}.md` - Detailed gap analysis with remediation plan

   **CRITICAL - Show Summary Only**:
   After writing the file(s), show ONLY a brief summary with coverage metrics and key gaps. Do NOT output the full traceability matrix content in your response, as matrices can be 800+ lines with detailed requirement-to-test mappings.

**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

### Step 0: Detect Version

Before generating the document ID, check if a previous version exists:

1. Look for existing `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-TRAC-v*.md` files in the project directory
2. **If no existing file**: Use VERSION="1.0"
3. **If existing file found**:
   - Read the existing document to understand its scope
   - Compare against current project artifacts and coverage
   - **Minor increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1): Scope unchanged — refreshed coverage metrics, updated gap analysis, corrected details
   - **Major increment** (e.g., 1.0 → 2.0): Scope materially changed — new requirement categories traced, fundamentally different coverage, significant new artifacts added
4. Use the determined version for document ID, filename, Document Control, and Revision History
5. For v1.1+/v2.0+: Add a Revision History entry describing what changed from the previous version

### Step 1: Construct Document ID

- **Document ID**: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-TRAC-v{VERSION}` (e.g., `ARC-001-TRAC-v1.0`)

### Step 2: Populate Required Fields

**Auto-populated fields** (populate these automatically):

- `[PROJECT_ID]` → Extract from project path (e.g., "001" from "projects/001-project-name")
- `[VERSION]` → Determined version from Step 0
- `[DATE]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME]` → "Requirements Traceability Matrix"
- `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-TRAC-v[VERSION]` → Construct using format from Step 1
- `[COMMAND]` → "arckit.traceability"

**User-provided fields** (extract from project metadata or user input):

- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Full project name from project metadata or user input
- `[OWNER_NAME_AND_ROLE]` → Document owner (prompt user if not in metadata)
- `[CLASSIFICATION]` → Default to "OFFICIAL" for UK Gov, "PUBLIC" otherwise (or prompt user)

**Calculated fields**:

- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Current date + 30 days (requirements, research, risks)
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Phase gate dates (Alpha/Beta/Live for compliance docs)

**Pending fields** (leave as [PENDING] until manually updated):

- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to "Project Team, Architecture Team" or [PENDING]

### Step 3: Populate Revision History

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit:traceability` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

### Step 4: Populate Generation Metadata Footer

The footer should be populated with:

```markdown
**Generated by**: ArcKit `/arckit:traceability` command
**Generated on**: {DATE} {TIME} GMT
**ArcKit Version**: {ARCKIT_VERSION}
**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME} (Project {PROJECT_ID})
**AI Model**: [Use actual model name, e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"]
**Generation Context**: [Brief note about source documents used]
```

### Example Fully Populated Document Control Section

```markdown
## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Document ID** | ARC-001-TRAC-v1.0 |

```

## Example Usage

User: `/arckit:traceability Generate traceability matrix for payment gateway project`

You should:

- Read ARC-*-REQ-*.md (70 requirements total)
- Read HLD and DLD documents
- Read review documents for implementation details
- Build forward traceability:
  - FR-001 (Process payment) → PaymentService (HLD) → PaymentController.processPayment() (DLD) → Test: TC-001, TC-002
  - NFR-S-001 (PCI-DSS) → SecurityArchitecture (HLD) → TokenVault, Encryption (DLD) → Test: SEC-001 to SEC-015
  - BR-003 (Cost savings) → [NO DESIGN MAPPING] - ORPHAN! (GAP)
- Calculate coverage:
  - Business Requirements: 14/15 (93%) - BR-003 missing!
  - Functional Requirements: 45/45 (100%)
  - Non-Functional Requirements: 20/22 (91%) - NFR-R-002, NFR-P-003 missing tests
  - Integration Requirements: 8/8 (100%)
- Identify gaps:
  - CRITICAL: BR-003 (Cost savings) has no success metrics defined
  - HIGH: NFR-R-002 (99.99% uptime) has no disaster recovery tests
  - MEDIUM: NFR-P-003 (Database performance) missing load tests
- **Overall Score**: 85/100 (Good, but gaps must be addressed)
- **Recommendation**: APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS - address 3 critical gaps
- Write detailed matrix to `projects/001-payment-gateway/ARC-001-TRAC-v1.0.md`
- Write gap analysis to `projects/001-payment-gateway/ARC-001-GAPS-v1.0.md`

## Important Notes

- Traceability is required for compliance (ISO, FDA, automotive, etc.)
- Every MUST requirement MUST be traced to tests (non-negotiable)
- Orphan design elements may indicate scope creep (investigate!)
- Orphan requirements may indicate incomplete design (blocking issue!)
- Traceability matrix should be updated throughout project lifecycle
- Use this for:
  - Go/no-go release decisions
  - Audit trail for compliance
  - Impact analysis for change requests
  - Test coverage verification
- A requirement is only "done" when it's implemented AND tested
- Missing traceability = missing accountability
- **Markdown escaping**: When writing less-than or greater-than comparisons, always include a space after `<` or `>` (e.g., `< 3 seconds`, `> 99.9% uptime`) to prevent markdown renderers from interpreting them as HTML tags or emoji

# ArcKit Command Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM)

This matrix shows which commands depend on outputs from other commands.

**Legend:**

- **M** = MANDATORY dependency (command will fail without it)
- **R** = RECOMMENDED dependency (command works better with it)
- **O** = OPTIONAL dependency (command can use if available)
- **Empty** = No dependency

**Reading the Matrix:**

- **Rows** = Commands that produce outputs
- **Columns** = Commands that consume those outputs
- Example: If row "principles" has "R" in column "stakeholders", it means stakeholders RECOMMENDS having principles first

## Command Groups by Dependency Level

### Tier 0: Foundation (No Mandatory Dependencies)

These commands can run first:

- **start** - Onboarding and navigation (console-only diagnostic, no file output; recommends `init` and `principles`)
- **plan** - Project planning and timeline (can optionally read: stakeholders, requirements, principles, sobc, risk if they exist)
- **principles** - Architecture principles

### Tier 1: Strategic Context (Depends on Foundation)

- **stakeholders** → Depends on: principles (R)

### Tier 1.5: Risk Assessment (Depends on Stakeholders)

- **risk** → Depends on: stakeholders (M), principles (R)

### Tier 2: Business Justification

- **sobc** → Depends on: stakeholders (M), risk (R), principles (R)

### Tier 3: Requirements Definition

- **requirements** → Depends on: stakeholders (R), sobc (R), principles (R)

### Tier 3.5: Strategic Planning (Platform Strategy, Roadmaps & Strategy Synthesis)

- **platform-design** → Depends on: principles (M), stakeholders (R), requirements (R), wardley (R), risk (O), sobc (O), data-model (O)
  - Note: Designs multi-sided platform strategy using Platform Design Toolkit (PDT) methodology
  - Best run after requirements when designing ecosystem-based platforms (Government as a Platform, marketplaces, data platforms)
  - Can run earlier if stakeholders and principles exist (requirements/wardley are recommended for better auto-population)
- **roadmap** → Depends on: principles (M), stakeholders (R), requirements (R), wardley (R), risk (R)
  - Note: Creates strategic architecture roadmap with multi-year timeline and capability evolution
  - Requires principles as foundation; stakeholders and requirements provide strategic context
- **strategy** → Depends on: principles (M), stakeholders (M), wardley (R), roadmap (R), sobc (R), risk (O)
  - Note: Synthesises strategic artifacts into executive-level Architecture Strategy document
  - Requires both principles AND stakeholders as mandatory inputs (unique among ArcKit commands)
  - Best run after creating principles, stakeholders, wardley, roadmap, and sobc for comprehensive strategy
- **framework** → Depends on: principles (M), requirements (M), stakeholders (R), strategy (R), data-model (R), research (R)
  - Note: Transforms architecture artifacts into a structured, reusable framework with principles, patterns, and implementation guidance
  - Agent-delegating command (runs autonomously via arckit-framework agent)
  - Best run after strategy and requirements when sufficient artifacts exist for framework synthesis
- **glossary** → Depends on: requirements (R), data-model (R)
  - Note: Generates comprehensive project glossary with terms, definitions, acronyms, and cross-references
  - Can run at any point once requirements exist; richer with more artifacts available

### Tier 4: Detailed Design (Depends on Requirements)

Most commands in this tier require or strongly recommend ARC-*-REQ-*.md:

- **data-model** → Depends on: requirements (M), stakeholders (R), sobc (O)
- **dpia** → Depends on: data-model (M), requirements (M), principles (R), stakeholders (R), risk (R)
- **research** → Depends on: requirements (M), stakeholders (R), data-model (R), platform-design (R)
  - Note: Also spawns `vendors/{slug}-profile.md` and `tech-notes/{slug}.md` for reusable knowledge (use `--no-spawn` to skip)
- **azure-research** → Depends on: requirements (M), data-model (R), stakeholders (R), MCP Server (External)
  - Note: Requires Microsoft Learn MCP server to be installed for authoritative Azure documentation
- **aws-research** → Depends on: requirements (M), data-model (R), stakeholders (R), MCP Server (External)
  - Note: Requires AWS Knowledge MCP server to be installed for authoritative AWS documentation
- **gcp-research** → Depends on: requirements (M), data-model (R), stakeholders (R), MCP Server (External)
  - Note: Requires Google Developer Knowledge MCP server (with API key) for authoritative Google Cloud documentation
- **datascout** → Depends on: requirements (M), data-model (O), stakeholders (R), principles (R)
  - Note: Discovers external data sources (APIs, datasets, open data portals) to fulfil project data requirements
  - Bidirectional with data-model: data-model is optional input, datascout recommends data-model updates as output
- **dfd** → Depends on: requirements (M), data-model (R), principles (O), diagram (O)
  - Note: Generates Yourdon-DeMarco Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) with structured analysis notation
  - Multi-instance document type (ARC-*-DFD-{NUM}-v*.md)
- **wardley** → Depends on: requirements (R), principles (R)
  - Note: Can create initial map without prerequisites; better maps with requirements and principles
- **diagram** → Depends on: requirements (M), platform-design (R)
- **adr** → Depends on: principles (R), requirements (R), stakeholders (O), research (O), wardley (O)
  - Note: Architecture Decision Records; principles recommended but can create decisions without them
- **data-mesh-contract** → Depends on: principles (M), data-model (R), stakeholders (R), diagram (R)
  - Note: Federated data product contracts for mesh architectures; requires principles for governance standards

### Tier 5: Procurement (Depends on Requirements)

Most procurement commands require ARC-*-REQ-*.md:

- **sow** → Depends on: requirements (M), research (R)
- **dos** → Depends on: requirements (M), stakeholders (M), sobc (R), research (R)
- **gcloud-search** → Depends on: requirements (R), Digital Marketplace access (External)
  - Note: Requirements recommended for search context but not mandatory
- **gcloud-clarify** → Depends on: requirements (M), gcloud-search (M)
- **evaluate** → Depends on: requirements (M), sow (M), principles (R), research (R), gcloud-clarify (R)
- **score** → Depends on: evaluate (M), requirements (M)
  - Note: Structured vendor scoring with JSON storage, comparison, and audit trail
  - Integrates with evaluate criteria; scores stored in `projects/{id}/vendors/scores.json`

### Tier 6: Design Reviews (Depends on Design Documents + Requirements)

- **hld-review** → Depends on: requirements (M), principles (M), HLD (M)
- **dld-review** → Depends on: requirements (M), principles (M), HLD (M), DLD (M)

- **mod-secure** → Depends on: requirements (M), principles (M), risk (R)
- **jsp-936** → Depends on: requirements (M), principles (M), mod-secure (R), risk (R) [for MOD AI systems]

### Tier 11: Project Story & Reporting (Depends on All Artifacts)

Final reporting commands that create comprehensive project narratives and presentations:

- **story** → Depends on: principles (M), all other artifacts (R)
  - Note: Requires principles as foundation; recommends multiple artifacts for comprehensive narrative
  - Generates comprehensive historical record with timeline analysis, traceability chains, governance achievements
  - Best run at project milestones or completion when most/all artifacts are complete

## Critical Paths

### Standard Project Path (Non-AI, Non-Government)

```text
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → research → wardley →
sow/evaluate → hld-review → backlog → servicenow → devops → operationalize →
traceability → principles-compliance → conformance → analyze → story
```

### UK Government Project Path

```text
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → datascout → data-model → research →
wardley → gcloud-search → gcloud-clarify → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review →
backlog → servicenow → devops → operationalize → traceability →
tcop → secure → principles-compliance → conformance → analyze → service-assessment → story
```

### UK Government Platform Strategy Path

```text
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → platform-design → datascout → data-model → research →
wardley → gcloud-search → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review → backlog → servicenow →
devops → operationalize → traceability → tcop → secure → principles-compliance →
conformance → analyze → service-assessment → story
```

### UK Government AI Project Path

```text
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → datascout → data-model → research →
wardley → gcloud-search → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review → backlog → servicenow →
devops → mlops → operationalize → traceability → tcop → ai-playbook → atrs → secure →
principles-compliance → conformance → analyze → service-assessment → story
```

### MOD Defence Project Path

```text
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → datascout → data-model → research →
wardley → dos → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review → backlog → servicenow →
devops → operationalize → traceability → tcop → mod-secure → principles-compliance →
conformance → analyze → service-assessment → story
```

### MOD Defence AI Project Path

```text
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → datascout → data-model → research →
wardley → dos → evaluate → hld-review → dld-review → backlog → servicenow →
devops → mlops → operationalize → traceability → tcop → mod-secure → jsp-936 →
principles-compliance → conformance → analyze → service-assessment → story
```

**Note**: analyze and service-assessment can also run earlier in the workflow to identify gaps in missing artifacts (all their dependencies are optional). The story command can be run at any project milestone to create a narrative snapshot, but is most comprehensive when run after all artifacts are complete. The paths above show the complete workflow with story as the final reporting step.

**Platform Design**: The platform-design command is used when designing multi-sided platforms (Government as a Platform, marketplaces, data platforms) and should be inserted after requirements definition but before detailed design. See "UK Government Platform Strategy Path" above.

- dld-review (M), backlog (M), diagram (R), servicenow (R), traceability (M), hld-review (validates it), service-assessment (M)
  - Note: analyze reads HLD directly if available (O), not via hld-review

**ARC-*-PLAT-*.md** - consumed by 6 commands:

- research (R), wardley (R), diagram (R), analyze (M), principles-compliance (R), service-assessment (R)

### Commands That Produce Critical Artifacts (High Fan-Out)

**requirements** produces ARC-*-REQ-*.md → consumed by 37 commands (highest)
**principles** produces ARC-000-PRIN-v*.md → consumed by 21 commands
**stakeholders** produces ARC-*-STKE-*.md → consumed by 22 commands
**HLD** (external) → consumed by 7 commands
**risk** produces ARC-*-RISK-*.md → consumed by 6 commands
**platform-design** produces ARC-*-PLAT-v*.md → consumed by 6 commands

---

## Design Notes

1. **ARC-*-REQ-*.md is the central artifact** - Nearly all downstream commands depend on it
2. **ARC-000-PRIN-v*.md is the governance foundation** - All design reviews check against principles
3. **Strategic order matters** - stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements ensures business justification before technical work
4. **Platform strategy bridges business and technical** - platform-design sits between requirements (business needs) and design (technical architecture), useful for ecosystem-based platforms
5. **Quality gates can run iteratively** - analyze and service-assessment have optional dependencies, allowing them to run early (identifying gaps) or late (validating completeness)
6. **Compliance assessments feed quality gates** - tcop, ai-playbook, atrs, secure, mod-secure, jsp-936 outputs are optionally consumed by analyze and service-assessment
7. **External artifacts** - HLD and DLD are created outside ArcKit but validated by hld-review/dld-review commands

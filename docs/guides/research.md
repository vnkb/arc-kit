# Technology Research Guide

`/arckit.research` investigates market, SaaS, open-source, and government marketplace options to support build vs buy decisions.

> **Agent Architecture**: This command delegates to the `arckit-research` autonomous agent. The agent runs as a subprocess with its own context window, performing dozens of WebSearch and WebFetch calls for vendor pricing, reviews, and compliance data without polluting your main conversation. The slash command launches the agent and relays its summary back to you.

## Scenario Matrix

| Scenario | Prompt seed | Focus |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Build vs buy | “Research options for <capability> and recommend build vs buy” | Compares custom development vs product |
| Supplier shortlist | “Research G-Cloud services for <need> including pricing tiers” | Public sector supplier discovery |
| Standards review | “Research regulatory obligations for <domain>” | Highlights policies, certifications, compliance |
| Migration | “Research tooling to migrate from <legacy> to <target>” | Guides modernisation approaches |
| Risk investigation | “Research security/operational risks for <technology>” | Informs risk register and mitigations |

Add constraints (budget, data residency, clearance) in the prompt for tailored results.

## Command

```bash
/arckit.research Research <topic> for <project>
```

Outputs: `projects/<id>/ARC-<id>-RSCH-v1.0.md` plus optional CSV of suppliers.

> **Auto-versioning**: Re-running this command when a document already exists automatically increments the version (minor for refreshed content, major for changed scope) instead of overwriting.

### Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--no-spawn` | Skip knowledge compounding — produce the research document only, without spawning vendor profiles or tech notes. |

---

## Output Highlights

- Option catalogue with pros, cons, pricing, support model.
- Alignment to requirements and principles.
- Risk considerations (lock-in, data sovereignty, accessibility).
- Recommendation with rationale and next steps (PoC, procurement, or custom build).

### Knowledge Compounding

In addition to the main research document, the agent automatically spawns standalone files for reusable knowledge:

- **Vendor profiles** at `projects/<id>/vendors/<vendor-slug>-profile.md` — one per vendor evaluated in depth (3+ data points).
- **Tech notes** at `projects/<id>/tech-notes/<topic-slug>.md` — one per significant technology finding (2+ substantive facts).

Existing profiles and notes are updated rather than duplicated. A `## Spawned Knowledge` section is appended to the research document listing everything created or updated. Use `--no-spawn` to skip this behaviour.

See the [Knowledge Compounding Guide](knowledge-compounding.md) for full details on deduplication, merge rules, and directory structure.

## Follow-on Actions

- Feed supplier data into `/arckit.sow` and `/arckit.evaluate`.
- Update Wardley Maps with evolution stage insights.
- Add identified risks to `/arckit.risk` and mitigations to project backlog.
- Cite findings in business case and design reviews.
- Review spawned vendor profiles and tech notes for accuracy before sharing.
- Reference vendor profiles from `/arckit.evaluate` scoring summaries.
- Use tech notes as input for `/arckit.adr` when making technology decisions.

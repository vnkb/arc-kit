## Overview

This is the **ArcKit SDG Mono-Repo** -- a single repository containing 17 UN Sustainable Development Goal workspaces, each with UK Government technology projects scaffolded for architecture governance using ArcKit.

**Total**: 17 SDG workspaces, 78 projects

## Navigation

Each SDG workspace is a self-contained ArcKit workspace under `sdg-{{NN}}-{{slug}}/`:

{sdg_listing}

## How to Use

1. Navigate to an SDG workspace directory
2. Use ArcKit slash commands to generate architecture artifacts for any project
3. Each project has its own `projects/{{NNN}}-{{slug}}/` directory with standard ArcKit structure

## ArcKit Commands

This repo uses the ArcKit plugin via the Claude Code marketplace. Commands are available as `/arckit.{{command}}` slash commands.

Key commands for getting started:
- `/arckit.stakeholders` -- Analyze stakeholder drivers and goals
- `/arckit.requirements` -- Define comprehensive requirements
- `/arckit.risk` -- Create risk register
- `/arckit.sobc` -- Create Strategic Outline Business Case
- `/arckit.research` -- Research technology options

## MCP Servers

Four MCP servers are configured for cloud platform research:
- **AWS Knowledge** -- AWS service documentation and recommendations
- **Microsoft Learn** -- Azure documentation and code samples
- **Google Developer Knowledge** -- GCP documentation
- **Data Commons** -- UN SDG indicators and statistical data

Enterprise Architecture Governance for UN Sustainable Development Goals -- UK Government Technology Projects

## Overview

This repository contains **{total_projects} UK Government technology projects** organised across all **17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. Each SDG is a self-contained ArcKit workspace with pre-scaffolded project directories ready for architecture artifact generation.

## SDG Workspaces

{sdg_table}

**Total: {total_projects} projects across 17 SDGs**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with ArcKit plugin enabled
- GitHub Codespaces (recommended) or local development environment

### Quick Start

1. Open this repo in GitHub Codespaces (Claude Code auto-installs via devcontainer)
2. Navigate to an SDG workspace: `cd sdg-01-no-poverty/`
3. Run ArcKit commands to generate architecture artifacts:

```bash
# Stakeholder analysis for a project
/arckit.stakeholders Universal Credit Modernisation

# Requirements specification
/arckit.requirements Universal Credit Modernisation

# Risk register
/arckit.risk Universal Credit Modernisation
```

## Overview

{description}

**SDG Alignment**: SDG {sdg_number} -- {sdg_name}

## Workflow

Use ArcKit commands to generate project artifacts in the recommended order:

### Discovery Phase
1. `/arckit.stakeholders` - Analyze stakeholder drivers and goals
2. `/arckit.risk` - Create risk register
3. `/arckit.sobc` - Create Strategic Outline Business Case

### Alpha Phase
4. `/arckit.requirements` - Define comprehensive requirements
5. `/arckit.data-model` - Design data model and GDPR compliance
6. `/arckit.wardley` - Create Wardley maps for strategic planning
7. `/arckit.research` - Research technology options (if needed)
8. `/arckit.sow` - Generate Statement of Work for vendor procurement (if needed)
9. `/arckit.evaluate` - Create vendor evaluation framework (if needed)

### Beta Phase
10. `/arckit.hld-review` - Review High-Level Design
11. `/arckit.dld-review` - Review Detailed Design
12. `/arckit.traceability` - Generate requirements traceability matrix

### Compliance (as needed)
- `/arckit.secure` - UK Government Secure by Design review
- `/arckit.tcop` - Technology Code of Practice assessment
- `/arckit.ai-playbook` - AI Playbook compliance (for AI systems)
